            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

YOUR GRACE, whoſe Illuſtrious
Name is more than once mention'd in

            <p>We have had ſuch ſlender Account

            <p>Our Author has been very careful

Service, and to whom Foreign Prints
have not given the full Commendations
they deſerve. Among thoſe Gallant
Men, YOUR GRACE holds an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent

Rank, in this <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> Thoſe
Honourable Wounds which You

and with admirable Courage
fought among the thickeſt of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,

You had in the Dangers of that Day.
What may we not promiſe our ſelves

            <head>THE
AUTHOR
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>LAſt Year I Publiſh'd a ſmall Narrative of
this Kind, to give an Account of the
Campagne for the Year 1692. I did not in
the leaſt deſign ſuch a Work when I was in the Field,
and ſo was not very careful to inform my ſelf of each
particular. When I came to <hi>London,</hi> I undertook
that <hi>Relation</hi> for a private Library, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any thought of making it publick; and tho'
'tis exact, as to the truth of the Matter contain'd
in it, I could have made it more perfect, if I had
been more curious and Inquiſitive in the Field.
This is alſo the reaſon that the Style is not ſo Correct
as it might have been; and as Winter was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
far ſpent when I reſolv'd to have it Printed,
the Book-ſeller made ſuch haſte to have it out, that
<pb facs="tcp:95918:5"/>
a great many Errors have crept into the Print,
eſpecially in Foreign and Proper Names. Such as
it was, I found it had the acceptance of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and that the Book was not altogether unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come:
If it pleaſe God to give me Life, another
Edition ſhall make it better.</p>
            <p>This, with the Promiſe I then made to the
Reader, had ingag'd me to undertake a juſt Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of the Laſt Campagne; and the Advantage both
of the Engliſh and French Tongues, has made me
curious and inquiſitive all along the Campagne, both
among Friends and among Strangers: Therefore I
believe the Reader will find this Account more Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
than the laſt, as I have made it more my Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
to get Intelligence, and to inform my ſelf of
ſeveral Matters: So that for the moſt part of what
I ſay, the Reader may believe that I have it from
good Hands.</p>
            <p>When we fought at <hi>Landen,</hi> I was then with
the Earl of <hi>Bathe</hi>'s Regiment in the Duke of <hi>Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
Detachment, Incamp'd almoſt under the
very Walls of <hi>Liſle;</hi> and therefore I ought to let
the Reader know what Credit he may give to my
Relation of that Engagement, which I did not ſee:
<pb facs="tcp:95918:5"/>
As for the Manner how the <hi>French</hi> attack'd us,
and the Order of their Battel, I have drawn it
out of their Relation printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> as the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
given of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the French King: And for the
Manner how we ſuſtain'd their Efforts, and the
Diſpoſition of our own Army, I have taken it out
of the Relation printed at the <hi>Hague,</hi> which bears
the Title of His Majeſty's Account of it to the
States of <hi>Holland:</hi> Both which are the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
that have been publiſh'd, and agree together in
every particular (as the Reader will find) except
in two or three Caſes which I have remark'd in this
Relation, <hi>viz.</hi> In the Attack of our <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oſt at <hi>Neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landen,</hi>
the French Account gives out that they had
the Advantage there, and ours, that we clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd
them: At their Second Repulſe at <hi>Neerwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
the French Account pretends that we had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Relief from our Body of Foot, and ours
ſays the contrary: The other Difference is in their
Summ of our Loſſes. I ſhall not ſtale the Truth
of the Matter here, which the Reader will find in
this Hiſtory: For the reſt, they agree ſo exactly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that the Reader finds them both made up
in this one Relation, which I may therefore ſay without
Vanity, is the moſt Perfect that has yet been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd.
I have added ſome Particulars which do
<pb facs="tcp:95918:6"/>
not alter the Subſtance of the Thing. I have them
from ſuch Perſons that I dare aſſure the Reader
of the truth of them.</p>
            <p>As for the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi>'s Expedition
into the French Conqueſts, I have been an Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of moſt of what I ſay, and therefore need make
no farther Apology. The Reader may believe me if
he pleaſes. I ſhall only deſire him to correct one
miſtake: I have ſaid, <hi>That the little River</hi> Eſpiers
<hi>went through the</hi> Foſſe <hi>of the Line of</hi> Wymbergs,
<hi>and</hi> Alfeld'<hi>s Attacks;</hi> but 'twas not ſo, it went
before, as upon our Attack at the Left; only at
<hi>Wymberg</hi>'s Attack 'twas ſo narrow, that they
eaſily made a way to paſs over with their Faſcines,
and at <hi>Alfeld</hi>'s Attack there was a good Bridge to
go over. Since I have made this Relation, I have
been preſented with a Draught of the Three ſeveral
Attacks, which is very finely and very exactly done.</p>
            <p>I muſt add concerning the Siege of <hi>Charleroy,</hi>
that moſt of what I ſay, is the News and Advice
we had in our Camp. The <hi>French</hi> have not yet
publiſh'd a Journal of it. What I ſay likewiſe of
the Baron <hi>de Reneſſe</hi> the Commandant of <hi>Huy</hi>'s
having been ſuſpended by a Council of War from his
<pb facs="tcp:95918:6"/>
Imployments, 'tis the News that have been publiſhed
about him; They may be true, or they may be falſe,
for any thing I know. I have alſo omitted the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of <hi>Saxe Gotha</hi> of Horſe, which the Reader
will be pleas'd to inſert in the Liſt of the Reſerve
under my Lord of <hi>Athlone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I preſent to the Reader my Hiſtory of
the <hi>Laſt Campagne,</hi> writ I dare ſay impartially,
as to Matters of Fact: As for the reſt, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
upon, and Concluſions from theſe ſeveral
Matters, are ſuch that the Reader is left to judge
whether they are juſt or no. And this is the only
thing in which I can be tax'd of Partiality, which
ſo far I am ſure is no Crime. I do only expreſs
my Zeal and Affection for the Cauſe in which I am
engag'd; and I ſhould be very ſorry to have writ
this Account ſo as to leave the Reader in ſuſpence,
whether I am for <hi>French Slavery</hi> or <hi>Engliſh Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I deſign, if God grants me Life and Health, to
give another Relation of the next Campagne. And I
heartily pray God that the Allies may be ſo earneſt
and zealous in their Work, that it may be the Laſt;
but above all, that we may every one of us, both
Allies and Enemies, ſo endeavour to amend our Lives,
<pb facs="tcp:95918:7"/>
and appeaſe the Wrath of God kindled againſt us,
that he may have pity upon the preſent Diſtractions
of Chriſtendome, and reſtoke among us all the bleſſings
of Peace.</p>

HISTORY
OF THE
Laſt CAMPAGNE
IN THE
Spaniſh Netherlands,
Anno Dom. 1693.</head>
            <p>MY Relation of the other Campagne, for
the Year 1692<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> finiſh'd with the Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of <hi>Furnes</hi> and <hi>Dixmuyde</hi> (both
which Places we poſſeſs'd our ſelves of,
by a Detachment from the Army at <hi>Granimen,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Command of Lieutenant General <hi>Talmaſh,</hi>
which afterwards join'd the Duke of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> with
Fifteen Battalions of the Tranſport Troops under
his Command, that had Landed at <hi>Oſtend)</hi> and
with the Marquis <hi>de <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>fflers</hi>'s and the Count <hi>de

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y,</hi>
which they abandon'd, after they had Bombarded
the Lower Town, ſituated on the other ſide of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95918:8"/>
               <hi>Sambre,</hi> for two days together; after which, both
Armies ſeparated, and went into Winter-Quarters.
But before we enter upon an Account of the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the <hi>Laſt Campagne,</hi> 'twill not, I believe,
be amiſs to ſay ſomething of what happen'd in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> during the laſt Winter-Quarters, which
may ſerve for a Connexion between the Hiſtory of
the <hi>Laſt</hi> and <hi>This Campagne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French,</hi> who ſeldom miſs an opportunity of
doing ſomething when it offers it ſelf, endeavour'd
the laſt Winter to make ſome Profit of thoſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
which the taking of <hi>Namur</hi> had given
them, in the Prince and Biſhop of <hi>Liege</hi>'s Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
for which end, they gather'd together a Body
of Men to Beſiege <hi>Huy,</hi> ſituated on the <hi>Maes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Namur</hi> and <hi>Liege,</hi> and actually Inveſted the
Place the 16/26 of <hi>December</hi> laſt, and they went on ſo
far in this Deſign as to make themſelves Maſters of
that part of the Town which lies on this ſide of the
River; but the Forces of the Allies, Quarter'd
upon and about the <hi>Maes,</hi> made ſuch diligence to
gather themſelves together, to make a Head againſt
the Enemy, that they were oblig'd to raiſe the Siege,
and to quit their Undertaking. The <hi>French</hi> Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,
who wou'd not have their Invincible Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
miſcarry in any thing that he undertakes, to
palliate this ill Succeſs, made it afterwards paſs only
for a Feint to amuſe the Allies, and to make their
Deſigns upon <hi>Furnes</hi> more ſucceſsful. But if a Man
will conſider of what Importance <hi>Huy</hi> was to the
<hi>French,</hi> who are ſo deſirous to perſwade or to force
the Biſhop of <hi>Liege</hi> to a Neutrality, that they may
have the Paſſage free to Attack the States General
in their own Dominions, and to make themſelves
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95918:8"/>
Maſters of <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> their moſt conſiderable Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon:
I ſay, if we conſider this, we muſt rather
think that the Feint (if any where) was at <hi>Furnes,</hi>
particularly ſince the Taking of this Place was not
follow'd with the Siege of <hi>Newport.</hi> However,
whether it was a Feint or no, Count <hi>Horne</hi> took
it for Earneſt.</p>
            <p>This Place was Inveſted by the Marquis <hi>de Boufflers,
December <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>9/19,</hi> who Encamp'd in the <hi>Downs</hi> between
it, <hi>Newport,</hi> and the Sea ſide. The Weather was
then ſo extraordinary bad, that 'tis the common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
there was no neceſſity of Surrendring the Place
at that Time; for tho' the Body of the Place was
not the beſt Fortified, having but two weak and
ſmall Baſtions, towards the Downs or Sand-Hills,
that their Angle flank'd was too ſharp, and the
Flanks but ſmall, and an over-long Courtin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them; yet this defect was at that time ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a very good <hi>Foſſé,</hi> well ſupplied with Water.
The Ravelins and Half-Moons which cover'd the
body of the Place, were much better than the
Baſtions, and more Capacious, the Counterſcarp and
Cover'd-way good and well Palliſado'd. The
Weather was ſo extraordinary bad at this time,
that our Forces which went out of the Gariſons of
<hi>Ghent, Bruges,</hi> and <hi>Oſtend,</hi> for its Relief, could
hardly March, the Ways were ſo deep and bad, that
ſeveral Soldiers went almoſt to the middle in Dirt,
and ſeveral Horſes remain'd ſtuck in it; and 'tis
very probable, that a League or two difference cou'd
not make ſuch a change in the conſtitution of the
Weather, as to make it more favourable for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
than it was for us. However, the Marquiſs <hi>de
Boufflers,</hi> notwithſtanding the badneſs of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95918:9"/>
made a ſhift to open the Trenches on <hi>New-Years-Day,
New-Stile.</hi> The third, in the Evening,
he fir'd ſome Cannon againſt the Place, and the
next Morning Count <hi>Horne</hi> Capitulated, and the
Gariſon march'd out with Bag and Baggage to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi>
conſiſting of five Battalions. As I remember,
they were Count <hi>Horne</hi>'s own Battalion. <hi>Noy<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lle</hi>'s,
<hi>S<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>heltinga, Wey,</hi> and <hi>Marquet. Dixmuyde</hi> which
was now hardly tenable by the Neighbourhood of
the <hi>French</hi> on both ſides at the <hi>Knocke</hi> and at
<hi>Furnes,</hi> was abandon'd by the <hi>Dutch</hi> Commandant,
in the abſence of Count <hi>Horne,</hi> who had both Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments.
The Gariſon of this Place conſiſted of
Si<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Battalions, of which Colonel <hi>L<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>der</hi>'s was one,
which Regiment afterwards went to Gariſon in
<hi>Oſtend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> continu'd very quiet in their Quarters
the remaining part of the Winter; and tho' 'twas
expected they wou'd be very buſie in the beginning
of the Spring, yet it paſs'd without any undertaking,
till both Armies took the Field. We did at leaſt
expect that the <hi>French</hi> would Form the Siege of
<hi>Charleroy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> very early, and before the beginning of
the Campagne, to pull this Thorn out of their Foot,
which Place did moſt Incommode them whilſt their
Armies were in the Field, by the frequent Attacks
it made upon their Convoys, and very often ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful:
So that for this particular Conſideration,
we may conclude this Siege wou'd have been more
for their Advantage if it had been the Prelude of
a Campagne. Doubtleſs the reaſon why it was not
Attack'd in the Spring muſt be becauſe of the great
Rains we had then, which hinder'd their Troops
from ſo early taking the Field; but why they did
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95918:9"/>
let it alone at the beginning of this Campagne,
and why they did let it remain in our Hands to
plague their Convoys, when the <hi>French</hi> King came
to Head his two numerous Armies, no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
can be given, but that the <hi>French</hi> King had
greater Deſigns in undertaking this Journey, than
the reduction of the weak Gariſon of <hi>Huy,</hi> or the
taking of <hi>Charleroy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the <hi>French</hi> King's Deſigns upon this Country
were very great for this Campagne, and far greater
than the Succeſs he has had in it: So our Indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable
Monarch has been no leſs Active and Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
to thwart and oppoſe them. To this end His
Majeſty came over from <hi>England</hi> the latter end of
<hi>March</hi> to the <hi>Hague,</hi> to conferr before the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Campagne with the Plenipotentiaries
of the Allies, and to ſettle with them the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
Methods for oppoſing the <hi>French</hi> Power,
that the Forces the Allies had then on foot cou'd
afford; whoſe Number is far from being ſo great
as we cou'd wiſh it, for the Benefit of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Cauſe. Afterwards his Majeſty went to <hi>Loo</hi>
to take the uſual Divertiſement of the Seaſon; but
ſtill ready to take the Field upon the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of the Weather, or as ſoon as the <hi>French</hi>
began to make their Motions in order to take the
Field.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> made very great Preparations this
Campagne to attack the Remnant of <hi>Flanders</hi> with
all Vigour, and greater than they had made hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
during this War. His moſt Chriſtian Majeſty
prepared two Powerful Armies to invade this
Country; which, beſides himſelf in Perſon, and the
<hi>Dauphin,</hi> were to be commanded by four Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chals
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95918:10"/>
of <hi>France,</hi> (viz.) <hi>Luxembourg, Boufflers, Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euſe,</hi>
and <hi>Villeroy:</hi> The firſt of theſe two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Armies
had its Rendezvous at <hi>Givry,</hi> between <hi>Mons</hi> and
<hi>Binch,</hi> under the Command of the Mareſchal <hi>Duc
de Luxembourg,</hi> with the Mareſchals of <hi>Joyeuſe</hi> and
<hi>Villeroy:</hi> The ſecond, commanded by the Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
<hi>de Boufflers,</hi> had its firſt Campment between
<hi>Antoing</hi> and <hi>Mount Trinité,</hi> within a Mile of <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay.</hi>
At the ſame time the Confederate Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to rendezvous in ſeveral Bodies; the moſt
conſiderable at <hi>Degham,</hi> between <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain,</hi>
and within half a Mile of <hi>Vilvorde;</hi> which
place, with the <hi>Canal</hi> of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> remain'd in our
Rear. On the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> the King, who had
left <hi>Loo</hi> to come to <hi>Breda,</hi> arriv'd at the Camp,
where his Majeſty was met by the Elector of <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
who conducted him to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> where they
held a Conference with Prince <hi>Vaudemont,</hi> and
Chief Officers, about the preſent State of Affairs;
and ſome days after Prince <hi>Vaudemont,</hi> who is very
much troubled with the Gout, left his Command
in <hi>Flanders,</hi> by the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s leave, to go to
the Bathes in <hi>Italy,</hi> where the Phyſicians gave him
hopes of a better Health: And his Majeſty took his
Quarters near <hi>Degham,</hi> in a Caſtle belonging to the
Prince of <hi>Taſſis,</hi> Maſter-General of the Poſt-Office
at <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> At the ſame time that part of our Army
rendezvous'd at <hi>Degham,</hi> another Body gather'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
near <hi>Ghendt,</hi> under the Command of the
Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> and Lieutenant-General <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſh,</hi>
conſiſting chiefly of the Gariſons of <hi>Ghendt,
Bruges,</hi> and <hi>Oſtend,</hi> where they were very well
poſted to obſerve the Mareſchal de <hi>Boufflers,</hi> in caſe
he would have attempted any thing in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:95918:10"/>
My Lord of <hi>Athlone</hi> commanded likewiſe a Body of
Horſe between <hi>Tongres</hi> and <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> drawn out
of our Gariſons upon the <hi>Meuſe.</hi> As for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry,
they remain'd in Quarters for the Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of our Towns upon that River; and ſuch
a Body was left in <hi>Liege,</hi> for the Guard of that
place, that the <hi>French</hi> (tho' they were ſo big with
their Expectations upon this City) yet they have
not thought it convenient to inſult it. Lieutenant-General
<hi>Tettau</hi> was left to Command in <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi>
with a conſiderable Gariſon; ſuch was the Care
that was taken for the Safety of our Towns upon
the <hi>Meuſe.</hi> Moſt of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Infantry encamp'd
near <hi>Ghendt,</hi> except what quarter'd at <hi>Mecklen,</hi>
and the two Battalions of the Royal Regiment,
<hi>Sellwyn</hi>'s and <hi>Stanley</hi>'s, which joyn'd the Army at
<hi>Degham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French,</hi>
               <note place="margin">May.</note> who had rendezvous'd in two ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Bodies, began to move; and <hi>Boufflers</hi> who
commanded the Second, march'd the <hi>20th.</hi> from the
Neighbourhood of <hi>Tournay</hi> to <hi>Leuze,</hi> the <hi>22d.</hi> to
<hi>Cambron,</hi> the <hi>23d.</hi> to <hi>Oboure.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> King,
who had left <hi>Verſailles</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> to come in Perſon
to Command his Armies in <hi>Flanders,</hi> arriv'd at
<hi>Queſnoy</hi> the <hi>15th.</hi> where he was ſtopp'd ſome few
days by reaſon of an Indiſpoſition, for which he
was twice let Blood; but upon his recovery he
joyn'd the Mareſchal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> the ſame day at
<hi>Oboure,</hi> and the ſame day ſaw the Army march be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him. The next, he review'd thoſe Troops
which the Mareſchal had there under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
Upon this Motion of the Mareſchal <hi>de
Boufflers</hi> from the <hi>Scheld</hi> towards <hi>Mons,</hi> to joyn
the Army commanded by the Mareſchal <hi>de Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:95918:11"/>
the Army near <hi>Ghendt,</hi> under the Command
of the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> and Lieutenant-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Talmaſh,</hi> had Orders to march, to come and
joyn our main Body, which continu'd encamp'd
at <hi>Degham;</hi> and accordingly they came the <hi>20th.</hi>
to <hi>Dendermond,</hi> and after they had march'd the <hi>22d.</hi>
to <hi>Stanhoff,</hi> and the <hi>23d.</hi> to <hi>Hamme,</hi> on the <hi>25th.</hi>
they paſs'd the <hi>Canal</hi> of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> at <hi>Vilvorde,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd
in a ſeparate Body between it and our
main Army.</p>
            <p>The ſame day the <hi>French</hi> King had made a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
of his Army under the Command of <hi>Bouf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flers,
Luxembourg</hi> decamp'd with his Army from
<hi>Givry,</hi> and continu'd his march towards <hi>Nivelle,</hi>
and encamp'd at <hi>Falay</hi> the day following; and the
<hi>French</hi> King, who now headed <hi>Boufflers</hi>'s Army,
came the <hi>26th.</hi> and encamp'd at <hi>Herlaymont-Capelle,</hi>
upon the River of <hi>Pieton,</hi> between <hi>Mons</hi> and <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy,</hi>
and within two or three Leagues of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
'Twas now expected that the <hi>French</hi> King
would not ſuffer this Gariſon to moleſt any more
the Convoys that came to his Army, and that he
would ſet down before it; but he had greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
in his Head than the reduction of this ſmall
Place, and ſo march'd on to <hi>Gemblours,</hi> where
both his Armies joyn'd, and made a formidable Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of 119700 Men, both Horſe and Foot; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting,
as 'tis always done the firſt opening of a
Campagne, every Battalion to conſiſt of 600 effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Men one with another, and every Squadron
of 150 Maîtres one with another. <hi>Boufflers</hi> had
in his Army 52 Battalions, 117 Squadrons. <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg</hi>
78 Battalions, 161 Squadrons. Total of
Battalions 130, which makes 78000 Foot. Total of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95918:11"/>
Squadrons 278, which makes 41700 Horſe. Total
of Horſe and Foot 119700 Men; which made more
than double the Number of our Army: So that if
it had not been for the ſpecial Care of His Majeſty,
and the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> the diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
our Forces and the Enemies was ſo great,
that the <hi>French</hi> King cou'd think of nothing leſs
than the forcing the Biſhop of <hi>Liege</hi> to a Neutrali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the making himſelf Maſter of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and the
overthrow of the Allies. There have been a great
many Liſts of this numerous Army printed both in
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> according to the Original pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
at <hi>Paris,</hi> nevertheleſs becauſe a particular
Liſt may very much contribute to the underſtanding

here, where it has its moſt proper place.</p>
            <p>Note, That thoſe Regiments that are mark'd with

I have in this Liſt given the Names to many of
the Brigades, not as they are in the printed Liſt of
the Army, but as we find them in the Relation of
the Battel of <hi>Landen</hi> printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> to make it
more Intelligible; and tho' the <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
did (no doubt) very much alter the Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of the ſeveral Brigades in the <hi>French</hi> King's
Army, from what 'twas at firſt when this Liſt was
publiſhed, yet you ſhall find moſt of the Brigades
by Name that the Author of that Relation makes
mention of, in this Liſt. This was the numerous
Army which the <hi>French</hi> King came to Head in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſtrong enough to have better an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
the Deſigns of his Voyage, conſidering how
inferiour we were to them in Number, if it had not
been for the Care His Majeſty and the Elector took
to thwart his ambitious Deſigns, by their prudent
ordering of Buſineſs upon the <hi>Maes,</hi> and in our
little Army a handful of Men, I may ſay, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of our Enemies Forces; which the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
may compare by the Liſt of our own Army
when at <hi>Park</hi>-Camp, which we ſhall hereafter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert.</p>
               <p>The King made ſuch Diligence to poſſeſs himſelf
of <hi>Park</hi>-Camp, by which he cover'd equally <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
Louvain,</hi> and <hi>Malines,</hi> that He entirely broke
the <hi>French</hi> King's Deſigns upon <hi>Brabant,</hi> unleſs the
Enemy had ventur'd to force us in our ſtrong Camp
at <hi>Park,</hi> which indeed would have been a deciding
of the Buſineſs; and worth the undertaking of ſo
great a Monarch as the <hi>French</hi> King's, conſidering
the prodigious Army he had, and that ſucceſs in ſuch
an Attempt promis'd him no leſs than all the great
and rich Towns in <hi>Brabant,</hi> as <hi>Bruſſels, Louvain,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95918:15"/>
Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Malines;</hi> and conſequently the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands;</hi> which wou'd
have been a more effectual way of bringing the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
to a Peace, than ſending a Detachment in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
under the <hi>Dauphin.</hi> But the <hi>French</hi> King did
not think it fit to hazard either his Perſon or his
Army at that time. 'Twas on the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> that
His Majeſty decamp'd from <hi>Degham</hi> to poſſeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of this ſtrong Poſt, which bauk'd the deſigns of
our numerous Enemies; and whereas His Majeſty
generally made two Marches from <hi>Degham</hi> to <hi>Parck,</hi>
the firſt to <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> yet upon this preſſing occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
the Army march'd it in one day, which prov'd
ſo hot Weather, that ſeveral Soldiers fell down dead
under their Arms. Our Right at this Camp was at
<hi>Havre,</hi> a Houſe belonging to the Duke of <hi>Arſchot,</hi>
where the Elector took his Quarter, cover'd by the
River <hi>Dyle, Louvain,</hi> and the little Brook that runs
from the <hi>Bois de Merdal</hi> to <hi>Parck-Abbey,</hi> and ſo to
<hi>Louvain,</hi> remain'd in our Rear: Our Left was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
by the ſtrong Defiles of the <hi>Bois de Merdal,</hi>
which from thence cover'd the Front of our Army
to the River <hi>Dyle,</hi> making with our Left Wing an
acute Angle. There remained between the <hi>Bois de
Merdal,</hi> and the River <hi>Dyle,</hi> a little ſpace of open
ground which cou'd give Paſſage to the Enemy in
our Camp; but this being commanded by the
heights of <hi>Birbeck,</hi> His Majeſty caus'd afterwards
ſeveral Battalions to Incamp there, as we ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
tell you, which were ſuſtained by a perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular
Line of Horſe and Dragoons between this
place and the Center of our Left Wing. The
Body, under the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> and Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
General <hi>Talmaſh,</hi> join'd us in this March, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95918:16"/>
Incamp'd in the Line. We were likewiſe join'd
with the Body of Horſe under my Lord of <hi>Athlone,</hi>
who had advanc'd as far as <hi>Tillemont,</hi> in order to
joyn us upon this March. He encamp'd a part in the
Rear of our Left Wing of Horſe, to make the Body
of Reſerve; ſo that our Army conſiſted then of the
Forces following.</p>

about a League from <hi>Louvain,</hi> in the way to <hi>Vilvorde,</hi>

out-number'd us by 58850 Men; ſo that the

After the French King had made this detachment
for the <hi>Rhine,</hi> he thought fit to return to <hi>Verſailles</hi>
without attempting any thing in this Country, where
his Majeſty arriv'd the <hi>16th.</hi> of <hi>June;</hi> ſo inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a Siege as that of <hi>Huy,</hi> was not worth his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.
Every body was very much ſurprized at this
return, but more particularly the Zealots of his own
Nation, who think that Victory and Conqueſt are
entail'd upon every Journey he undertakes: They
have been very much puzl'd to reconcile this with
their Invincible Monarch's Glory: Some have fancied
(to make it out) that the French King's Journey in
<hi>Flanders</hi> was but a Feint for the Allyes to bring their
beſt Forces here, to make his deſign'd Conqueſts more
ſure in <hi>Germany;</hi> and when the <hi>Dauphin</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd,
they fancied this Project ſo ſure, that they
talk'd before-hand of nothing but of his Conqueſts
and Victories upon the <hi>Rhine;</hi> and a Man wou'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
believe by their Writings, that they expected
the <hi>Dauphin</hi> wou'd have had his Winter Quarters
at <hi>Vienna,</hi> and ſhared the broken Empire with the
<hi>Grand Signior.</hi> And as Triumph muſt attend the
French King wherever he goes, ſo becauſe he cou'd
meet with no other in this Journey, they made this
Project paſs for a Triumph of Wiſdom, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-piece
of Policy; but it has pleas'd God that in
this deſign they have reckon'd without their Hoſt,
and ſo have been oblig'd to reckon twice. The
Allyes upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> under the Command of the
brave Prince of <hi>Baden,</hi> have been ſo Watchful and
Unanimous, that the <hi>Dauphin</hi> has made as fruitleſs
a Journey upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> as the King his Father
had done in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and is return'd to <hi>Verſailles</hi>
without attempting any thing upon the Empire.</p>

After the French King had left his Army, and
that the <hi>Dauphin</hi> had march'd with his detachment
towards the <hi>Rhine, Luxembourg</hi> advanc'd with the
Army as far as <hi>Meldert</hi> in ſight of our own his
Right near <hi>Tillemont,</hi> and his Left at <hi>Florival</hi> upon
the River <hi>Dyle,</hi> which Abbey the <hi>French</hi> (who ſpare
nothing tho' in their opinion Sacred) ſpoil'd and
plunder'd. The French King's Quarters were mark'd
at <hi>Meldert,</hi> and <hi>Luxembourg</hi> took his at <hi>Cluis.</hi> The
<hi>Bois de Merdal</hi> remain'd between us, and equally
cover'd our left Wing of Horſe and the Body of our
Army. The <hi>French</hi> poſſeſs'd themſelves of the Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of <hi>Valdue,</hi> a Cloiſter of <hi>Benedictin</hi> Nuns, ſituated
almoſt in the middle of the Wood, where they kept
a continual Guard. The Ground between the skirts
of this Wood and the River <hi>Dyle</hi> being ſomething
open, his Majeſty order'd a detachment of ſix <hi>Engliſh</hi>
and <hi>Scots</hi> Regiments, <hi>(viz.)</hi> two of the Royal Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Bathe, Collinwood, Scots</hi> Fuziliers and <hi>Levens,</hi>
to Incamp upon the Heights, and amongſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filés

            <p>On the <hi>7th.</hi> in the Evening, the <hi>French</hi> entertain'd
us with a <hi>Feu de joy,</hi> that is, a tripple diſcharge of
their Artillery and ſmall Shot, which was drawn out
of their Lines for that purpoſe, to expreſs their Joy
for the taking of <hi>Roſes</hi> by the Mareſchal <hi>de Noailles</hi> in
<hi>Catalonia.</hi> We found that their fire went a prodigious

great length of Ground upon which the French Army

            <p>The thick and cloſe Wood of <hi>Merdal</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
between us and the Enemy, gave opportunity
to a prodigious multitude of Deſerters on both ſides

their own Native Troops, which deſerted as
well as Forreigners: On our ſide 'twas never known
that the King's Subjects deſerted ſo much as they
did in this Camp, but moſt of them were <hi>Iriſh Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholicks,</hi> who were debauch'd from the Service
by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Prieſts at <hi>Louvain,</hi> who when our Army
is near this place, are very buſy to alienate the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
affections from his Majeſties Service: There
were daily Executions in both Armies to deterr Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
from it, and to hinder them from running away
by Cabals. His Majeſty publiſh'd a Proclamation,
to promiſe a reward of 100 Guilders, or Ten pounds
Sterling, to any Soldiers that would diſcover ſuch
as had a mind to Deſert, beſides their Diſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>arge, if
they ask'd for it; which afterwards hinder'd them
from deſerting in Companies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Mareſchal <hi>de
Luxembourg</hi> put forth an Edict for the ſame purpoſe,
promiſing a reward of 30 Crowns, beſides their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge,
to ſuch Soldiers as would diſcover their
Contrades that had a mind to deſert.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>14th.</hi> of this Month at night, there was
a very great Storm of Thunder and Rain, which
caus'd a great deal of miſchief in both Armies: All
thoſe Battalions which encamp'd in lower Grounds
were overflow'd with the Torrents of Water, their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95918:21"/>
Tents and Baggage ſwimming; but the greateſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
was at the King's Quarter, among the Sutlers
and Toy-Shops, which being under Banks of ſandy
Ground that made the hollow Way, the Banks broke
in upon them, and buried a great many of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and all the Ground about the Abby of <hi>Park</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
under Water, where, beſides thoſe that
were kill'd by the fall of the Banks, many were
drown'd in it.</p>
            <p>Whilſt we were in this Camp, we ſent weekly
Detachments to <hi>Arſchot, Dieſt,</hi> and <hi>Leuwe,</hi> to hinder
the <hi>French</hi> from Foraging on the other ſide of the
River <hi>Rupel;</hi> particularly that at <hi>Leuwe,</hi> which was
ſtill commanded by a Field-Officer, being pretty
near the Right of the French Army, very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoded
their Forragers, and daily took either
Men or Horſes.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>20th.</hi> we made a conſiderable Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the Gariſon of <hi>Charleroy,</hi> where we had
ſent ſome Horſe and Dragoons for ſuch Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
This Detachment conſiſted of 500 Horſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Command of Colonel <hi>de Bay,</hi> 400 Dragoons
under the Prince of <hi>Steenhuys,</hi> with 50 Granadiers
ſuſtain'd by 500 Foot of that Gariſon commanded
by Colonel <hi>Heyden,</hi> which forced afterwards the
Line between <hi>Mons</hi> and <hi>Maubeuge,</hi> took firſt the
Redoubt <hi>Vieuxreng</hi> defended by ſeveral <hi>Suiſſers,</hi> of
whom they put 50 to the Sword; and afterwards
they forc'd ſix other Redoubts, where they made
200 Priſoners; amongſt which were three Captains,
three Lieutenants, and three Enſigns: After they
had forced this Line they enter'd the Enemies
Country, and rais'd Contribution as far as <hi>Maubeuge;</hi>
and brought back with them a great many head of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95918:22"/>
Cattle, beſides Hoſtages for ſuch Contributions
which had not been paid in ready Money.</p>
            <p>We made another Attempt ſome days following
from the ſame Gariſon of <hi>Charleroy,</hi> where we had
not equal ſucceſs. The <hi>French</hi> had prepared at
<hi>Beaumont</hi> a great Convoy of Money for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Army for ſix Weeks, beſides Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
and Proviſions. Lieutenant-General <hi>du Puy,</hi>
who had been commanded from the Army with a
Detachment of Horſe and Dragoons to aſſiſt the
Gariſon of <hi>Charleroy</hi> in their Attempts upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Convoys, made with the ſame Colonel <hi>de Bay</hi>
a ſmall Body in order to attack it upon the way to
the French Army. The Enemies Convoy was eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corted
with a Detachment from the Gariſons of
<hi>Namur, Mons,</hi> and <hi>Maubeuge,</hi> under the Commands
of the Counts <hi>de Guiſcard, Vertillac,</hi> and <hi>Ximenes,</hi>
their reſpective Governours. <hi>Du Puy</hi> and <hi>de Bay,</hi>
who had advanced with their Horſe and Dragroons,
fell upon the Convoy at <hi>Boſſu,</hi> where the diſpute
was hot for ſome time, but the French Convoy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too ſtrong for them, they were forc'd to retreat
to their Body of Foot, which was not yet come
up; after which the <hi>French</hi> left off the purſuit,
content to have ſav'd their Convoy; and tho' re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforc'd
with our Foot, yet <hi>du Puy</hi> did not think
himſelf ſtrong enough to Rally for a ſecond At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
Many were kill'd and wounded in this Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
on both ſides. The Allies loſt three Officers
and a good number of Soldiers. On the French ſide
many were kill'd, but their moſt conſiderable loſs
was of the Count <hi>de Vertillac</hi> Governour of <hi>Mons,</hi>
who was wounded mortally, and dy'd ſoon after:
The French King has ſince diſpos'd of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95918:22"/>
to Monſier <hi>de Lubanie,</hi> Mareſchal de Camp and
Commandant of <hi>Calais.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French,</hi> whilſt at <hi>Meldert,</hi> had ſtill ſeveral
ſmall Parties which ſculk'd up and down the <hi>Bois
de Merdal,</hi> to be ready to paſs out of the Wood
upon occaſion to ſteal our Horſes, which we often
ventur'd to graze thereby upon ſcarceneſs of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage:
They have taken a great many of our Horſes
that way, but particularly on the <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>June</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Horſes of my Lord of <hi>Bathe</hi>'s Regiment gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
thereabouts, with a Serjeant and ten Men to
look after them, a Party of the <hi>French</hi> ſallied out
of the Wood, and wounded three of the Soldiers:
The <hi>French</hi> after they had taken four of Sir <hi>Bevil
Granville</hi>'s Horſes, retir'd into the Wood, the wounded
Soldiers were brought off, and two of them are ſince
dead of their Wounds.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> and we whilſt our reſpective Camps
of <hi>Meldert</hi> and <hi>Park,</hi> ſeem'd to try who cou'd keep
them longeſt. On our ſide we were very much put
to it for want of Forrage, and the <hi>French</hi> on theirs
ſuffer'd great want of Proviſions; for, beſides that
<hi>Namur</hi> was then their neareſt Gariſon, from whence
they cou'd have ſubſiſtence, their Convoys that
brought them Proviſions were not very ſafe for the
Neighbourhood of <hi>Charleroy,</hi> unleſs they had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſtrong Eſcorte, which they cou'd have but ſeldom.
'Twas their Intereſt to endeavour by their long ſtay
at <hi>Meldert</hi> to force us to leave the Camp at <hi>Park</hi>
for want of Forrage, that <hi>Louvain,</hi> remaining open to
them, might fall into their Hands; and alſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
as much Forrage as they cou'd hereabouts,
and between this and the <hi>Maes,</hi> to hinder our Army
from marching that way, when they ſhould attempt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95918:23"/>
any thing thereabouts. His Majeſty (loſt the
<hi>French</hi> by their obſtinacy ſhou'd cauſe an univerſal
want of Forrage in our Camp) order'd Hay, and
Oats, and other dry Forrage to come from <hi>Holland</hi>
for the ſubſiſtence of the Army at <hi>Park,</hi> rather than
be oblig'd to decamp firſt for want of it. The
<hi>French</hi> perceiving that there was no likelihood of
our decamping firſt, and their Army ſuffering very
much for want of Proviſions, reſolv'd at length to
quit firſt their Camp at <hi>Meldert;</hi> which according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they did the <hi>28th.</hi> The Right Wing march'd by
one of the Clock in the morning, and the reſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
with all the ſecreſie poſſible, leſt we ſhou'd
make ſome attempt upon their Rear-Guard: And
we were near Neighbours enough to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
ſuch a thing if we had but had timely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.
Early in the morning we ſaw all their Camp
in a flame, which gave us the firſt news of their
marching; upon which his Majeſty got on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
and form'd a conſiderable Body of Horſe out
of our Left Wing, with which his Majeſty endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to overtake the Enemy's Rear-Guard, but
it prov'd too late. The King rid into the Enemy's
Camp, and view'd it. Some of our Refugies Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
came near enough to ſpeak with ſome of their
acquaintance of the French Army, which they
found ſtragling behind. A very deep way remain'd
between them, which hinder'd any other Action but
Compliments on both ſides; they conſented mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
to a Truce to have a little diſcourſe together;
but a ſmall Party of our Horſe which knew nothing
of the agreement, came up another way, fir'd amongſt
them, and broke the Conference. The <hi>French</hi> march'd
this day to <hi>Heyliſſem,</hi> making their way towards the
<hi>Meuſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:95918:23"/>
'Twas then that we expected to know what deſigns
the <hi>French</hi> had that way;<note place="margin">July<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> The King, who endeavour'd
as much as lay in his Power to fruſtrate them all, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
a Detachment to march inceſſantly towards
<hi>Flanders,</hi> to attack the French Lines that cover'd his
Conquer'd Country in it, by this means to oblige the
<hi>French</hi> to do the ſame thing to ſecure their Country
from our Invaſion. Lieutenant General <hi>Tetteau,</hi> who
encamp'd between <hi>Liege</hi> and <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> with 13 Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions
(as many as could be ſpar'd out of thoſe two
Gariſons ſince the Detachment upon the <hi>Rhine)</hi> lay
ready to fill up the room of this Detachment in our
Army, and as the <hi>French</hi> cou'd not expect ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement,
if they had detach'd towards the Line,
it would in all probability have ſaved <hi>Huy,</hi> and in
caſe they did not, it did put us in a condition to
raiſe good Contributions in their Country, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
the loſs of that place. 'Twas for this
reaſon that His Majeſty order'd on the firſt a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
of 13 Battalions and 40 Squadrons, under
the Command of the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> to march
towards the Lines, with the Marquis <hi>de la Foreſt</hi> of
Horſe, <hi>Wymberg</hi> and <hi>Ellemberg</hi> of Foot, Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
under him. Of Horſe, <hi>Hubert,</hi> &amp;c. of Foot,
<hi>Alfeldt, Bernſtorf, L'Ecluſe</hi> and <hi>Rhingrave,</hi> Brigadiers;
the 13 Battalions were <hi>Bathe, Argyle,</hi> Daniſh Guards,
Queens, Prince <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> Prince <hi>George, Jutland,
Torſay, L'Ecluſe, Bernſtorf, Rhingrave, Wymberg,</hi> and
<hi>La Motte</hi> of <hi>Lunenbourgers;</hi> Of the Horſe, the
Duke of <hi>Leinſter</hi>'s Regiment was one. After this
Detachment had been made, Lieutenant General
<hi>Tetteau</hi> came up with his 13 Battalions to reinforce
our Army.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:95918:24"/>
The ſame day that we were detach'd from the
Army, under the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> the Foot
march'd as far as <hi>Vilvorde,</hi> under the Command of
Major General <hi>Ellemberg;</hi> the Horſe march'd on
faſter for more Expedition. The ſecond we came
to <hi>Mellem,</hi> after we had paſs'd the <hi>Canal</hi> at <hi>Vilvorde.</hi>
The third we met with very foul Weather, that
made our march very troubleſome and difficult. It
Thunder'd and Rain'd for moſt part of the day,
inſomuch that the Ways became almoſt unpaſſable,
particularly for our Baggage; however, we made
a good march that day, and paſs'd the <hi>Dender</hi> at
<hi>Aloſt,</hi> a pretty clean and neat Town, which the <hi>French</hi>
took in the Wars of 1667. diſmantl'd it, and ſo it
has continu'd ſince without any Fortification, till laſt
Year that the Spaniſh Forces made a Winter-Quarter
of it; for which end they have made an indifferent
Breaſt-work, and Palliſado'd the place, which they have
renew'd again this Year for the ſame purpoſe. After we
paſs'd the <hi>Dender</hi> at this place, we encamp'd at <hi>Meyer,</hi>
and ſo march'd the next day to <hi>St. George Oudenhore,</hi>
and paſs'd the <hi>Scheld</hi> the day following at <hi>Oudenarde.</hi>
This is one of the moſt conſiderable Gariſons the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> has in this Country, extreamly well
Fortified. 'Tis commanded by a Hill on the <hi>Mons</hi>
ſide of the <hi>Scheld,</hi> that quite overlooks the Town,
which expoſes it very much to Bombs and Fire-Works
from an Enemy, but they have ſuch Sluces
within their Works that they can overflow when
they pleaſe all about the Town, except at <hi>Deynſe-Port</hi>
which is the only place where the Enemy can break
Ground, and open a Trench before the place. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
tho' it be ſo ſtrong by nature, and ſo well
Fortified by Art, the <hi>French</hi> have made themſelves

Maſters of it in both the Wars ſince the <hi>Pyrenean</hi>
Treaty, and have reſtor'd it again by thoſe of <hi>Aix
la Chapelle,</hi> and <hi>Nimeguen.</hi> We encamp'd in this
place, juſt on the other ſide of the Town, after we
had paſſed the <hi>Scheld.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> who with the Major
Generals <hi>La Forreſt</hi> and <hi>Wymberg</hi> haſted on before
with the Detachment of Horſe, arriv'd at <hi>Oudenarde</hi>
on the third, where he was joyn'd by ſeveral Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
from our Neighbouring Gariſons to reinforce
his Detachment. We had from <hi>Bruges,</hi> my Lord
<hi>Caſtleton</hi>'s Regiment; from <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> Baron <hi>Spaar</hi> and
<hi>Wey;</hi> from <hi>Charleroy,</hi> the Regiments of <hi>Carle, Heyden,</hi>
and the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi>'s; from <hi>Ath, Potbus,</hi> and
<hi>Slayembourg;</hi> from <hi>Audenarde, Scheimelpenning,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the two <hi>Walloon</hi> Regiments of the Count <hi>de
Falay,</hi> and the Vicount <hi>d' Audrigny,</hi> which came out
under the Command of the Count <hi>de Libercey,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Audenarde,</hi> who had orders to joyn us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Gentleman of old Experience, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
the Country where we were going very
well. We were likewiſe accompanied by the Count
<hi>de Bergeth,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Intendant for <hi>Flanders,</hi>
to take in the Contributions, and to account for
them. On the fourth, Prince <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> with the
Horſe and Battalions that had joyn'd him at <hi>Aude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narde,</hi>
marched on towards the Line, and encamp'd
in preſence of the Enemy before <hi>D' Otignies,</hi> where
he expected the coming up of Major General <hi>Ellem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergh</hi>
to back his undertaking.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ellembergh,</hi> who with the 13 Battalions under his
Command, had on the fifth paſs'd the <hi>Scheld</hi> at <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denarde,</hi>
march'd the next day in order to join the
Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> before the Lines; The Artillery
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95918:25"/>
conſiſting of 12 Pieces of Canon, of which two
were 12 Pounders, joyn'd us upon this march, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
Tin-Boats, and all manner of Ammunitions,
under the Convoy of Count <hi>Horne</hi>'s Regiment. As
this march was great, we halted when we came to
St. <hi>Denys,</hi> within a League of the Lines, to refreſh
our Men; but we were taken with ſuch a violent
Storm of Thunder and Rain, that the Artillery,
and Boats, and Ammunitions remain'd unmoveable,
and the great Torrents of Water gather'd ſo faſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in a little Valley between us and the Lines,
thar Count <hi>Horne</hi>'s Regiment which march'd firſt,
cou'd but juſt wade through, and ſeveral of the
Rear of the Regiment were drown'd in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage;
upon which, the reſt of the Forces that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd,
were forced to the Right about, and to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
a Paſſage another way, but all in vain; ſo
that 'twas impoſſible for us to come to Prince <hi>Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg</hi>
that Night, which grieved both him and us
very much to meet with Weather ſo unſeaſonable for
our Undertaking. We were forced to lye that
Night in the dirt by the Water-ſide, without any
ſhelter for want of our Baggage, and of convenient
ground to incamp upon. The Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi>
who upon our approach, had march'd about half a
League to the Right before <hi>Maucron,</hi> to leave to us
the Attack at <hi>D' Otignies,</hi> had left only ſome Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
of Horſe there, which, with Count <hi>Horne</hi>'s
Regiment that only cou'd come up to the Line that
Night, were very much Inferior to the Enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them. To cover this weakneſs of theirs, our
Quarter-Maſters and their Men had orders to borrow
ſome Drums from Count <hi>Horne</hi>'s Regiment, and
about the dusk of the Evening to beat ſometimes
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95918:25"/>
the <hi>Engliſh, Scotch, German,</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Marches, as
if our Battalions had then been coming up to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp
there; and afterwards to beat their ſeveral
Retreats. They made likewiſe ſeveral Fires all the
length that was mark'd for our Camp, and the
Quarter-Maſters went the Rounds, and Sentries
challeng'd with as much noiſe as they could, to make
the Enemy believe we were come up. Early in
the next Morning, we that had been hinder'd from
joining by the great Torrent of Waters which had
fallen in the Storm of Thunder the day before,
found that theſe Torrents diſſipated themſelves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
in as little time as they had gather'd together,
and ſo found the ways paſſable by Three of the Clock,
at which time we began to march, and joyn'd our
Forces very early that Morning, coming up to the
Ground that had been mark'd for us by our Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Maſters,
juſt before the Enemies Line. Prince
<hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> who took great compaſſion of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
ſufferings in this march, that had continu'd
8 days together, moſt in very foul Weather, order'd
a quantity of Corn-Brandy of about ſix Gallons to
be diſtributed to each Company, in every Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
to chear up our Soldiers, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
cleans'd and fix'd their Arms (which had
been very much ſpoil'd by the foul Weather) for
the approaching Service. The Rain continu'd the
ſeventh, and the ground ſo deep that we went al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
to the Knees in dirt in our Camp; which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
hinder'd our Artillery and Ammunition from
coming, by the badneſs of the Ways, till late in the
Evening. The Weather was ſo very bad that it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
daſh'd the hopes we had in this Undertaking.</p>

            <p>Prince <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> as we have ſaid before, had
mov'd from <hi>D'Otignies</hi> with the Right Wing of
Horſe, and the Battalions that had join'd him at
<hi>Audenarde,</hi> about half a League to the Right, and
encamp'd before the Redoubt of <hi>Maucron,</hi> to make
room for the 14 Battalions under the Command of
<hi>Ellemberg,</hi> that were to encamp at <hi>D'Otignies;</hi> ſo
that in all we made 25 Battalions, 14 with <hi>Ellem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi>
and 11 with the Prince; and about 40 Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
of Horſe; with which on the <hi>8th,</hi> (as it
prov'd fair Weather) Prince <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> reſolv'd
to attack the <hi>French</hi> in their Lines. For which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Boors had been order'd the day before,
and this morning, to bring a great quantity of Faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
to our Camp. The Prince left the Right to
come in Perſon to our Attack upon the Left; after
which Major-General <hi>Wymberg</hi> commanded at the
Right. Count <hi>D'Alfeldt,</hi> Brigadier of the <hi>Danes,</hi>
was order'd with four Battalions to attack the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt
at <hi>Pont-David,</hi> in the Center between us
and the Right; theſe four Battalions were <hi>Argyle,</hi>
his own or Prince <hi>George, Wymberg,</hi> and <hi>La Motte.</hi>
The order of the Attack was on this manner; Firſt
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95918:30"/>
an advanced Party of Granadiers under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of a Captain; then a Detachment of 30
Pikes <hi>per</hi> Battalion to carry Faſcines to fill the
Ditch, and their Pikes carried bound up together
four and four to lay under the Faſcines; then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
all the Granadiers under the Command of a
Field-Officer. Upon the Left Attack the Granadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were commanded by a Dutch Lieutenant-Colonel,
and Major <hi>Chavonne</hi> of <hi>Torſay</hi>'s Regiment.
Our Artillery was advanced upon an adjoyning
heighth that overlook'd the Enemies Line, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of nine Pieces of Cannon upon the Left Attack,
and three we had ſent upon the Right. After the
Granadiers follow'd the Battalions drawn up upon
three Lines on the Left Attack to ſuſtain one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
We march'd in this order till we came very
near Musket-ſhot of the Redoubts, and then we
were order'd to halt. Three Pieces of Cannon
were fir'd upon the Right for a Signal that they
were ready to begin the Attack, which we anſwer'd
with three like Pieces to ſhew the ſame diſpoſition
upon the Left; and afterwards our Cannon began
to fire upon the Enemy; the ſmall Field-Pieces
fir'd upon the Corps de Guarde of the Redoubt to
make that Poſt uneaſie for the Soldiers that were
lodg'd in it, and our two twelve Pounders fir'd
upon the Enemies Horſe that were drawn up in
a Line, mounted on Horſe-back at more diſtance,
and fronting us. The <hi>French</hi> ſet two Houſes on
fire within half Musket-ſhot of the Redoubt upon
our Left, leſt they ſhould ſhelter our Foot that
were going to attack them. As ſoon as the Cannon
began to play, both our Detachments upon the
Right of us, that is <hi>Wymberg</hi> and <hi>Alfeldt</hi> began to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95918:31"/>
attack the Enemy. The <hi>Walloons</hi> with my Lord
<hi>Caſtleton</hi>'s Regiment had the Van upon the Right,
and my Lord of <hi>Argyle</hi> in the Center Attack. The
<hi>French</hi> made a pretty good defence for about half
an hour together, but their Redoubts were not ſo
ſtrong there as before us upon the Left. A Way
went through the Redoubt of <hi>Pont-David,</hi> ſo that
Brigadier <hi>Alfeldt</hi> had only the Barriere and Paliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſado's
to attack; and upon the Right the little Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ran through the <hi>Foſſé</hi> of the Line about the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt
of <hi>Maucron:</hi> Tho' the Enemy were weakeſt
at theſe two Attacks, yet 'twas where they made
the beſt defence; <hi>Alfeldt</hi>'s Redoubt was defended
by the <hi>Suiſſers,</hi> who made a very brisk fire upon
us; <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Granadiers had the Van and ſuffer'd
very much in this Attack: The firſt Lieutenant was
kill'd upon the place, and the ſecond wounded, and
about fifteen of the Company kill'd upon the ſpot,
beſides the wounded. After that <hi>Wymberg</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feldt</hi>
had fir'd ſo briskly for ſome time upon the
Right, we upon the Left, where Prince <hi>Wirtemberg</hi>
was in Perſon, were order'd to march on and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
the Redoubt. The attempt was difficult in this
place, becauſe the River did not run here through
the <hi>Foſſé,</hi> but made another Ditch about twenty
paces from the Counterſcarp of the Redoubt and
Line, and both very deep and full of Water by
the great Rains we had before. But that which
incourag'd our Soldiers mightily, was, that our
Cannon, particularly the two 12 Pounders, plai'd ſo
briskly upon the Horſe, that they were oblig'd to
ſhelter themſelves behind the Hedges and Trees of
a neighbouring Village. My Lord of <hi>Bathe</hi>'s Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
went on the firſt next to the Granadiers, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95918:31"/>
by <hi>Torſay</hi>'s Regiment, and Count <hi>Horne</hi>'s up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Left. All the Men expreſs'd a great deal of
Reſolution and Joy, particularly my Lord of <hi>Bathe</hi>'s
(the only Engliſh Regiment at this place) gave
ſeveral Huzza's according to the Cuſtom of our
Country. Our Pike-men, that were cover'd by
their Faſcines, march'd to the very brink of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
within 30 paces of the Redoubt, and when
they came to fling their Faſcines in the River, they
found that the Stream carried them away; the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadiers,
who were very eager, immediately flung
themſelves into the River to get on t'other ſide;
and tho' they are ſtill the talleſt and beſt of the
Foot, yet the River was then ſo deep that moſt
of them either ſwam or went to the Neck in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
And when they came to t'other ſide, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
fir'd two or three Diſcharges round from the
Redoubt, both upon the Granadiers and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Plattons of the advanced Battalions. The
Left Plattons of my Lord of <hi>Bathe</hi>'s Regiment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neareſt the Redoubt which they flank'd, fired
upon the Enemy, which cover'd very much our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadiers,
who ſtill went on, and had Orders not to
fire till they came to the very Paliſſado's of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt.
But in the mean while, Major-General
<hi>Wymberg,</hi> and the Count <hi>D'Alfeldt</hi> who expos'd
himſelf very much in this Action, having carried
their Attacks, our Cavalry upon the Right got
within the Line at the Paſſage of <hi>Pont-David,</hi> and
form'd their Squadrons in order to attack the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Horſe; but as they had now reaſon to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
leſt we ſhou'd charge them both Front and
Flank, they had Orders to quit the Redoubt we
were attacking upon the Left, which otherwiſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95918:32"/>
cou'd not have been ſo eaſily carried, and with the
loſs of ſo little Blood. Two Battalions that lin'd
the Retrenchment to our Left of this Redoubt,
march'd off form'd and Colours flying, but they
were ſo much expos'd to our Cannon, that our
Shot fell very thick among their Diviſions upon
their Retreat; for which reaſon the reſt did not
obſerve ſo much order, but retreated as they could
by the favour of ſome Hedges and Houſes juſt by.
The Horſe rid off as faſt as they cou'd, and about
200 Men which defended the Redoubt made a
ſmall fire once, and ſo abandon'd it. The Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
then flung themſelves in the Ditch, as deep, if
not deeper than the River, and ſo came the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſado's,
which they broke down, and ſo got upon
the Redoubt with their Swords in their Hands.
The Officers, and ſome of my Lord of <hi>Bathe</hi>'s Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadiers,
were the firſt in it. The Battalions cou'd
not follow ſo faſt, becauſe the Stream of the River
carry'd the Faſcines away, ſo that we cou'd not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
make a Bridge with them; but as ſoon as it
cou'd be done, a vaſt many Boors, who had been
commanded for that purpoſe, paſs'd to pull down
with their Shovels and Spades a convenient ſpace of
the Line for our Horſe and Foot of the Left to
march thorough: After which we laid a Bridge
over the Ditch of the Line, and ſo both Horſe and
Foot got within the Enemies Retrenchments. Whilſt
we were getting in, one of the Enemies Squadrons
appear'd out of the Village of <hi>D'Otignies</hi> to obſcure
us; but they did not think fit to ſtay there long,
and ſo went off to the Right-about. They made
26 Priſoners at Count <hi>D'Alfeldt</hi>'s Attack, and found
three ſmall Pieces of diſmounted old Cannon, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95918:32"/>
               <hi>Bathe</hi>'s Granadiers got a large Barrel of good French
Brandy in the Corps de Garde of their Redoubt.
After we had got within the Line, the Battalions
drew up upon the riſing Ground, and Detachments
both of Foot and Horſe were ſent in purſuit of the
Enemy; but they had haſten'd to get to t'other
ſide of the Paſs at St. <hi>Leger</hi> before we cou'd over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
them, only ſome of their Waggons fell into
our hands. The Soldiers took the Liberty to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which they did that night with a witneſs:
They ſet all the Country about us in a flame, and
burn'd at leaſt twelve Villages, beſides the Churches
of <hi>Verigny</hi> and St. <hi>Leger,</hi> where the Boors had heap'd
all their moveable Goods, and the Soldiers ſet fire
to what they could not bring off along with them,
which was the occaſion of burning thoſe two
Churches to conſume what was in them of the
Boors Goods. At <hi>Verigny</hi> ſome of them went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church to endeavour to ſave ſomewhat of
what was their own, as Flax, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and two or three
remain'd in the flames.</p>
            <p>In the Evening Prince <hi>Wirtemberg</hi>'s Army joyn'd
together in one Body, and march'd to t'other ſide
of the Village of <hi>D'Otignies,</hi> where it encamp'd
upon two Lines; and the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi>
took his Quarter in that very Houſe, where the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs
<hi>de la Valette</hi> had his. This is a conſiderable
Village, which belongs to the Prince of <hi>Steenhuys,</hi>
Colonel of a Regiment of Dragoons in the King
of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Service; and to reap ſome benefit of
his Eſtate in the French Conqueſts, his Mother
lives at <hi>Menin</hi> to hinder it from being forfeited into
the French King's hands; which is a way that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Perſons of Quality have in this Country
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95918:33"/>
to preſerve their Eſtates in the French Conqueſts.
The Marquis <hi>de la Valette,</hi> after he had been forc'd
from his Poſt within the Lines, retir'd to <hi>Pont a
Treſein</hi> upon the River <hi>Marck,</hi> within two Miles of
<hi>Liſle,</hi> to try t'other puſh at the defence of that
Paſs. The next day the Regiments we had left to
guard the Line for that night march'd into our
Camp, and the Boors were order'd from all the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages
about as far as <hi>Audenarde,</hi> to come and level
the Line, and the Enemies Works, from the <hi>Lys</hi> to
<hi>Pont d' Eſpiers</hi> upon the <hi>Scheld,</hi> between three and
four Leagues in length; which they have done,
tho' not ſo throughly as it ſhou'd have been. The
Villages our Soldiers had ſet on fire the over-night,
caus'd a very great Conſternation throughout the
Country, and tho' 'twas a very miſerable ſight, yet it
produc'd this good effect, that it made the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the Chatellenie of <hi>Courtray,</hi> which extends it
ſelf beyond <hi>Tournay,</hi> to come in the readier to pay
their Contributions. On the <hi>9th.</hi> the day after
we had come within the Lines, Prince <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi>
to prevent the Diſorders which Soldiers might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
put out a Proclamation forbidding all Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to rob, plunder, or ſpoil any of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
upon pain of death, nor to ſet any Houſe
or Church on fire upon pain of being burnt alive.
But at the ſame time he took care that the Country
ſhou'd bring in <hi>gratis</hi> Refreſhments to the Soldiers,
as Cows, Sheep, and Corn-Brandy; and they had
this in ſuch plenty, that every Company in each re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
Battalion had generally two Cows a Week,
and the Officers upon each Company a couple of
Sheep: And ſo Prince <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> remain'd ſome
days encamp'd at <hi>D'Otignies,</hi> as well to refreſh his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95918:33"/>
Soldiers, who moſt of them had now march'd eight
days together, as to ſettle the Contributions with
the Inhabitants of the Chattellenie of <hi>Courtray.</hi> And
here we ſhall leave him for ſome time, to ſpeak of
what the two Armies were doing towards the
<hi>Meuſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We had left the Enemy encamp'd at <hi>Heyliſſem,</hi>
the <hi>28th</hi> of the laſt Month, which Camp they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
left to come nearer to the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> and encamp'd
at <hi>Borchworm,</hi> or <hi>Warem,</hi> a Town belonging to the
Biſhop of <hi>Liege,</hi> ſituated upon the River <hi>Jaar</hi> or
<hi>Jecker,</hi> which has its riſing near the <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
three Leagues of <hi>Huy,</hi> and ſo runs the ſame
courſe as the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> by <hi>Warem, Lootz, Tongres,</hi> and
at laſt falls into the <hi>Meuſe</hi> at <hi>Maeſtricht.</hi> Count
<hi>Cerclaes</hi> of <hi>Tilly,</hi> General of the <hi>Liege</hi> Troops, was
at the ſame time with a Body of five Regiments of
Horſe, and three of Dragoons, encamp'd near <hi>Tongres,</hi>
with a deſign to joyn our Army to reinforce
it; of which the Mareſchal <hi>de Luxembourg</hi> was adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd
by the Marquis <hi>de Neſle,</hi> whom he had ſent upon
Party to get Intelligence. <hi>Luxembourg</hi> thought
'twas neceſſary to hinder this Reinforcement from
joyning our Army; and therefore reſolv'd to attack
it. To compaſs this deſign, orders were given for
eight Squadrons of the King's Guards, two of the
<hi>Gens d Armes,</hi> and of the Light Horſe, the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Horſe Granadiers, and three of Horſe, to
march between ſix and ſeven at Night, as ſecretly as
poſſible, to come and joyn him ſome diſtance from
thence, where he expected them, beſides other Troops
both Horſe and Foot, as many as wou'd make a Body
of 10000 Men. The Foot march'd on ſtreight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
becauſe they did not know very well whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95918:34"/>
               <hi>Tilly</hi> had any Foot with him or no, and about
an hour before Night <hi>Luxembourg</hi> march'd at the
Head of the Horſe upon two Columnes, he at the
Head of the one, and the Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy</hi> at
the Head of the other. They march'd as faſt as they
cou'd without breaking Order all the Night, till
about three in the Morning, at which time they were
come within two Engliſh Miles of the place where
they expected to find the Count <hi>de Tilly,</hi> when they
mended their pace to poſſeſs themſelves of a heighth
from whence they could diſcover Count <hi>Tilly</hi> upon
the March, who had been advertiz'd about Midnight
of the Enemies deſign: Upon which he gave orders
for the Baggage to load immediately, and to march
off, but yet they had not ſo much time, but that
a great deal of it fell into the hands of the <hi>French.
Luxembourg</hi> perceiving that Count <hi>Tilly</hi> had been a
little too quick for him, order'd ſome of his beſt
mounted Horſe to file off, and to ride as faſt as they
cou'd to overtake him, whilſt the reſt of the Horſe
ſhould follow them the great Trot. The Princes of
the Blood, who were at the head of them, came
pretty near <hi>Tilly</hi>'s Horſe, after they had paſs'd ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
hollow ways; but when they expected to fall
upon them, they found juſt between them and <hi>Tilly</hi>'s
Flank a very deep and hollow way, where 'twas
impoſſible for their Squadrons to paſs: Only about
100 of them found a way to harraſs them upon
their Flank; but <hi>Tilly</hi>'s Horſe, which there made
up the Rear, conſiſting of ſix or ſeven Squadrons,
being very much preſs'd by the narrowneſs of the
Ground, and beſides having expreſs Orders not to
engage, only skirmiſh'd with them retreating, whilſt
<hi>Telly</hi>'s main Body rid on to get a Village where to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95918:34"/>
repaſs the <hi>Jecker.</hi> In the mean while the Princes
were looking for a convenient place where they might
Charge theſe Squadrons upon the Flank, but when
they came to it, they found but few of <hi>Tilly</hi>'s Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
that made the Rear, the reſt retreating as
faſt as they could. The <hi>French</hi> purſu'd theſe very
briskly within two hours of <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> where
Count <hi>Tilly</hi> was forc'd to retire, after he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
that the Ways to <hi>Liege</hi> were poſſeſs'd by
the Enemy. We had on Count <hi>Tilly</hi>'s ſide one
Colonel, Lieutenant-Colonel, Major, and two Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants
made Priſoners, and the beſt part of the
Baggage taken. On the French ſide Monſieur
<hi>Sanguinet,</hi> Exempt of the Life-Guards, was kill'd,
and the Duke of <hi>Montfort,</hi> Son to the Duke of
<hi>Chevreuſe,</hi> wounded; the Marquis of <hi>Thiange</hi> wounded,
and about 50 of the Life Guards and Carabiniers,
kill'd or wounded.</p>
            <p>Immediately after this Succeſs, the Mareſchal
<hi>de Luxembourg</hi> reſolved to Beſiege <hi>Huy,</hi> which place
he caus'd to be Inveſted the <hi>9th.</hi> This Town is
ſituated upon the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> between <hi>Liege</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</hi>
the beſt part of it on the other ſide of the
<hi>Meuſe,</hi> towards the <hi>Condros,</hi> (for ſo that part of
the Principality of <hi>Liege</hi> is called, which lies on
the other ſide of the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> between <hi>Liege, Huy,</hi>
and <hi>Dinant)</hi> the other on this ſide of the River,
to which 'tis joyn'd by a Bridge, but at the beſt
but a Dirty poor Town. The Caſtle is on the
<hi>Condros</hi>-ſide of the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> ſeated in the midſt of
the Town, upon a ſteep Hill and a ſolid Rock.
The Caſtle is ſmall, and commanded by adjoyning
Hills. At the foot of the Hill (whereon the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
is ſeated) ſtands the chief Church of the Town.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95918:35"/>
This Place in the laſt Wars, after the then Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Cologne</hi> and Biſhop of <hi>Liege,</hi> had left the
French Party to enter into the League, was Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd
and Taken by the Mareſchal <hi>de Rochefort</hi> in
the Year 1675. This Town, before the taking of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</hi>
was only Inviron'd with a weak Stone Wall,
as we have in our ancient Towns in <hi>England,</hi> but
ſince they have made ſeveral Half-Moons, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments
about it, to make the place more
Defenſible. The Baron <hi>de Reneſſe,</hi> Brigadier of the
Biſhop of <hi>Liege</hi>'s Forces, Commanded in it with a
Gariſon of near 2000 Men. Upon the approach
of the Enemy, they abandon'd that part of the
Town ſituated on this ſide of the River, and broke
down the Bridge upon the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> that joyn'd it to
the other. The Commandant had promis'd to make
as good defence as the ſituation of the Caſtle, which is
upon the Rock, cou'd afford; for tho' 'tis commanded,
yet it is of ſo difficult Acceſs, that 'twas almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to Aſſault it after the Breach had been made
by the Enemies Cannon; ſo that we expected 7 or
8 days reſiſtance from it; but the Commandant did
not think fit to ſtay ſo long to deliver up the Place
into the Enemies hands. The ſame day that the
Marquis <hi>de Harcourt</hi> had Inveſted <hi>Huy,</hi> the Enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to batter the Town with their Cannon; and the
<hi>10th.</hi> it Surrender'd upon Condition that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
and Gariſon ſhould have liberty to retire
into the Caſtle. Afterwards they Summon'd the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Fort <hi>Picard</hi> to Surrender, which is a New Work
that had been made upon the point of a Rock, but
not yet finiſh'd. The Officer that Commanded,
agreed to yield it upon Condition he ſhould have
the liberty to retire into the Caſtle with his Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95918:35"/>
which the Enemy refus'd; upon which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to defend himſelf till the <hi>13th.</hi> that 'twas Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd
at diſcretion, and the Gariſon made Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of War. The ſame day the Enemy fir'd their
Bombs and Cannon into the Caſtle: In the Evening
the Granadiers of the Regiment of <hi>Orleans</hi> made
themſelves Maſters of an old Tower within 100 Paces
of the Caſtle, which commanded the Way to the
Breach which the Enemy's Cannon had begun to
make upon the Place, and the next day the <hi>14th.</hi> the
Governour Capitulated. The Conditions agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were, that he ſhould be conducted ſafely to
<hi>Liege</hi> with his Gariſon: But the <hi>French,</hi> contrary
to the Capitulation, retained them upon pretence of
Moneys due to the Cardinal of <hi>Furſtemberg,</hi> who is
one of the Canons of <hi>Liege.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Majeſty having been inform'd that the <hi>French</hi>
had Inveſted <hi>Huy,</hi> reſolv'd to march nearer to the
<hi>Meuſe</hi> to watch after the ſecurity of <hi>Liege,</hi> and
accordingly on the <hi>10th.</hi> the Army march'd from
<hi>Parck</hi> (where we had hitherto remain'd Incamp'd) to
<hi>Tillemont,</hi> and the over-night all our heavy Baggage
was order'd to be ready to march the next day to <hi>Dieſt.</hi>
The <hi>11th.</hi> the Army continu'd its march from <hi>Tille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
to <hi>Neerheſpen,</hi> after it had paſs'd both the <hi>Geets,</hi>
and halted the next day. <hi>13th.</hi> the Army march'd
on to <hi>Vellem,</hi> having the Town and Abbey of <hi>St. Tron</hi>
in the Rear, and the day following the King advanc'd
as far as <hi>Hupertingue,</hi> our Right near <hi>St. Tron,</hi> and
our Left near <hi>Tongres,</hi> where his Majeſty heard of the
ſudden Capitulation of the Caſtle of <hi>Huy,</hi> whoſe weak
Defence the Biſhop of <hi>Liege</hi> has ſo much reſented,
that he has ſince order'd the Baron <hi>de Reneſſe</hi> to be
Tried by a Council of War, with a great many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95918:36"/>
Officers of the Garriſon. The Baron <hi>de Reneſſe</hi>
has been condemn'd thereupon to three Months Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,
and to be ſuſpended from his Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for the ſpace of one Year: Of the other
Officers ſome have been Suſpended, and ſome Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved;
but one who had broke Priſon, and fled,
has been order'd to be hang'd <hi>in Effigie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the taking of <hi>Huy,</hi> the Mareſchal <hi>de Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg</hi>
drew nearer to <hi>Liege,</hi> and Incamp'd at <hi>Hellick,</hi>
as if he had ſome Deſign upon that Place; of which
the King being inform'd, detach'd 10 Battalions to
reinforce the Garriſon under the Command of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadier
<hi>Swerin,</hi> who underwent very great Dangers
and Hazards, but at length got ſafely into the place.
After the King had made this detachment for <hi>Liege,</hi>
and 3 to <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> he march'd back on the <hi>15th.</hi>
to the Camp at <hi>Neerheſpen.</hi> The Mareſchal of
<hi>Luxembourg</hi> being Incamp'd at <hi>Hellick,</hi> and his Right
not very far from <hi>Liege,</hi> ſent to the Biſhop to offer
him a Neutrality; upon which the Biſhop call'd a
Chapter, where 'twas deliberated by them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
almoſt unanimouſly, except by two or three
Cannons in the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, who endeavour'd to
raiſe a Mutiny among the People to compaſs their
end; whereupon they were taken into Cuſtody, and
ſent Priſoners to <hi>Maeſtricht.</hi> The firſt Biſhop of this
Dioceſs, according to their Hiſtory, was <hi>St. Mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
one of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Diſciples, who preached the
Goſpel here, and had his See at <hi>Tongres,</hi> then a very
big and populous City, where it continued till St. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatus,</hi>
upon ſome diſguſt with the Inhabitants, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
it to <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> from whence 'twas afterwards
transferr'd to <hi>Liege</hi> upon this Occaſion. St. <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> was Murder'd about that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95918:36"/>
place where the Cathedral of <hi>Liege,</hi> dedicated to him,
does now ſtand. St. <hi>Hubert,</hi> who at firſt was a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
that lived by Hunting in the Forreſt <hi>d' Ardenne,</hi>
being by a Miracle (as their Legend gives out) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to the Chriſtian Faith, grew into ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of Sanctity, that he was choſen for the
Succeſſor of St. <hi>Lambert,</hi> that had been Murder'd at
<hi>Liege.</hi> This Biſhop was afterwards advertiz'd in a
Dream, to transfer his See from <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> to <hi>Liege,</hi>
with the Bones of St. <hi>Lambert,</hi> where he afterwards
began the Cathedral Church, and dedicated it to
his Predeceſſor. There are three Orders of Secular
Cannons in this Church: (1) The Cannons of
St. <hi>Lambert,</hi> who are always choſen out of the beſt
Families of <hi>Liege, France,</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> and in Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
at Church are cloath'd in Purple Furr'd Robes,
whereas other Cannons are onely cloath'd with Black
Robes lin'd with Furr. The Cardinals of <hi>Bouillon</hi>
and <hi>Furſtemberg,</hi> are both at this time Cannons of
St. <hi>Lambert</hi> in this Church. (2) The Cannons of
St. <hi>Maternus;</hi> and (3) thoſe of St. <hi>Servatus,</hi> firſt
Biſhop of <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> whom we may call Petty Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.
His Majeſty has the rich Barony of <hi>Herſtal</hi> juſt
without the Gates of the Town towards <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi>
which he holds immediately from the Emperour, ſo
call'd, <hi>quaſi ſtabulum Domini;</hi> and they ſay, that
King <hi>Pepin</hi> of <hi>France</hi> kept his Court ſometimes at
this Place, who was a great Benefactor to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of this Dioceſs, as well as to that of <hi>Rome.</hi>
We ſhall at preſent leave <hi>Luxembourg</hi> at his Camp
at <hi>Hellick,</hi> and the King at <hi>Neerheſpen,</hi> juſt entring
upon the moſt Important Action of this Campagne,
to ſpeak ſomething of our Affairs within the Lines,
where we have brought the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi>
to the Camp of <hi>D'Otignies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:95918:37"/>
On the <hi>12th.</hi> of this Month Prince <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> left
the Camp at <hi>D'Otignies,</hi> and march'd by the Paſs
of <hi>St. Leger</hi> over a Bridge of Boats, and ſo came to
<hi>Eſquermes,</hi> our Left then within a good <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile
of <hi>Tournay.</hi> Upon which, two Regiments of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons,
that had been at the defence of the Lines,
got into the Town that very Evening to reinforce
the Gariſon. This Town has undergone ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions,
and was once in the hands of the <hi>French</hi>
in the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> I, but was retaken by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Charles</hi> V, and ſo it continued in the poſſeſſion
of the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> till that great Irruption which
the <hi>French</hi> made in <hi>Flanders</hi> in the Year 1667, after
the death of <hi>Philip</hi> IV King of <hi>Spain,</hi> upon pretence
of a Right which the Queen of <hi>France</hi> had to theſe
Countries immediately after the death of her Father.
The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who thought themſelves ſecure by
the Sacredneſs of the Pyrenean Treaty, had left all
their Frontiers unprovided, and ſo in one Year the
French King made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Liſle, Tournay,
Douay, Courtray, Ath, Audenarde,</hi> and <hi>Charleroy,</hi> &amp;c.
which were all again reſtor'd to the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
by the Treaty of <hi>Aix la Chappelle,</hi> except <hi>Liſle, Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rnay,</hi>
and <hi>Charleroy.</hi> The moſt conſiderable Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the Town that had any Lands thereabouts,
came out and paid their Contributions, and among
the reſt, the rich Abbot of the Abbey of St. <hi>Martins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The day after we had Incamp'd at <hi>Eſquermes,</hi> the
Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> order'd a ſtrong Detachment
of 1200 Horſe and 600 Foot, commanded by Colonel
<hi>Potbus,</hi> all under the Command of Brigadier <hi>Hubert,</hi>
with three Pieces of Cannon, to force the Paſs at
<hi>Pont a Treſein,</hi> where the Enemy had above 2000
Men to defend it. This is a Bridge over the River
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95918:37"/>
               <hi>Marck,</hi> about two Engliſh Miles from <hi>Liſle,</hi> upon
the way between it and <hi>Tournay,</hi> which is along
a very good Cauſway, rais'd above five Foot higher
than the Grounds about, and Pav'd with good Stone.
There are very good Barriers of Paliſado's upon the
Bridge, behind which the Enemy had made a ſmall
Barricade, beſides a great many Houſes by the River
ſide, which cou'd have been defended. When Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadier
<hi>Hubert</hi> came near with his Detachment, the
Enemy drew out ſome Men upon the Cauſway, and
Poſted them among the Houſes to defend the Paſs;
the Fire continu'd a little time on both ſides, but
when our Cannon was once come up, they forſook
the Cauſway and Houſes, and retir'd within the
Barriers of the Bridge, where they ſeem'd reſolute
to defend it: Upon which a Detachment of all the
Granadiers there, was made under the Command of
a Dutch Lieutenant-Colonel, their Number about
200, to go and force the Bridge; at the ſame time
our three Pieces of Cannon favour'd this Detachment
by their Fire upon the Enemy, having been planted
in a convenient place after we had made our ſelves
Maſters of the Houſes upon this ſide of the Bridge.
The Enemy fir'd very briskly for ſome time upon
our Detachment of Granadiers, who notwithſtanding
went up to the very Paliſado's of the Barriere, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
(as they march'd on) their Fire upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.
Our Detachment of Engliſh and Scotch
Granadiers, who had the Van in this Action, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd
themſelves very well, and got the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and applauſe of their Commanding Officer,
who was an Eye-witneſs of their Bravery. As
ſoon as our Granadiers came up to the Paliſado's,
they fell on to cut them down with their Sabres;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95918:38"/>
Our Cannon, which play'd at the ſame time, and
the reſt of the Detachment that follow'd to ſuſtein
them, made at laſt the Enemy reſolve to quit this
Poſt. We found ſeveral of their Men kill'd upon
the place, their Number 14 or 15, the loſs
about equal on our ſide; no Commiſſion Officers,
only one Engliſh Sergeant. We cou'd hear the
Fire during this Attack very plain from our Camp
at <hi>Eſquermes.</hi> After this Defeat, the Enemy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
to the other ſide of <hi>Liſle,</hi> leaving a ſmall
Body for the Guards of the Paſſes of <hi>Pont a Ventin</hi>
and <hi>Haubourdin,</hi> which lead into the <hi>Pais d' Artois.</hi>
The ſame day that Brigadier <hi>Hubert</hi> had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd
to force the Paſs of <hi>Pont a Treſein,</hi> we were
joyn'd by the Regiment of <hi>Scheltingua</hi> from the
Gariſon of <hi>Ghendt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt we were Incamp'd at <hi>Eſquermes</hi> ſo near
<hi>Tournay,</hi> we made the Inhabitants of the Countrey
come in with their Contributions all along the <hi>Scheld,</hi>
as far as <hi>Mortagne,</hi> where 'tis joyn'd by the <hi>Scarpe,</hi> and
ſo on along the <hi>Scarpe</hi> from from <hi>St. Amand</hi> and
<hi>Marchiennes,</hi> as far as <hi>Douay.</hi> On the <hi>15th.</hi> the two
Walloon Regiments of Count <hi>Falay</hi> and the Vicount
<hi>d' Audrigny,</hi> were detach'd to reinforce Brigadier
<hi>Hubert,</hi> who remain'd Incamp'd at <hi>Pont a Treſein;</hi>
And the Chatellenie of <hi>Liſle</hi> being now open to us
after we were Maſters of this Paſs, the Duke of
<hi>Wirtemberg</hi> followed the <hi>17th.</hi> with his whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to raiſe Contributions there; and as we were
to leave <hi>Tournay</hi> behind us in this march, ſo the
Duke order'd that day a good Rear-Guard of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions
of <hi>Bathe, Caſtleton,</hi> and <hi>Argyle,</hi> beſides ſeveral
Squadrons of Horſe under the command of Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
Count <hi>d' Alfeldt.</hi> Some of the Enemy's Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95918:38"/>
of the Gariſon of <hi>Tournay</hi> appear'd in ſight of
the Rear-Guard, t'other ſide of a Defile, upon our
Left Flank, about a Mile beyond <hi>Templeur;</hi> upon
which Count <hi>d'Alfeldt</hi> order'd to draw up in Battel,
and ſo we march'd as long as the Ground would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it: We paſs'd the <hi>Marck</hi> that Evening at <hi>Pont a
Treſein,</hi> where we joyn'd Brigadier <hi>Hubert,</hi> and
encamp'd at <hi>Anapes,</hi> within two ſmall <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles
from <hi>Liſle,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>VVirtemberg</hi> took his
Quarter at a Caſtle belonging to the Count <hi>d'Anapes,</hi>
and ſo ſummon'd the Inhabitants of the Chattellenie
of <hi>Liſle,</hi> to come in and pay their Contributions.
The Town of <hi>Liſle</hi> (in Latin <hi>Inſulae,</hi> becauſe ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
among a great many croſs Rivulets between
the <hi>Marck</hi> and the <hi>Deule,</hi> which form ſo many Iſlands)
is a very large, handſome, and populous City, the
largeſt Town next to <hi>Ghendt</hi> in the Province of
<hi>Flanders,</hi> and the beſt of the French Conqueſts. 'Tis
the place where reſides the Governour General of
the <hi>Païs Conquis,</hi> at preſent the Mareſchal <hi>d' Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mieres.</hi>
There is a very fine Cittadel, of which
Monſieur <hi>de Vauban</hi> is Governour, the moſt famous
Ingenier this day in <hi>Europe,</hi> and a Man may call
this his Jewel, for he has ſpar'd neither Art nor Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to make it the fineſt Citadel, and the beſt in
<hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt we were encamp'd at <hi>Anapes,</hi> 'twas diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd
either that we ſhould puſh our point farther,
and have forc'd the Paſſes of <hi>Pont a Ventin</hi> and
<hi>Haubourdin</hi> upon the River <hi>Deule,</hi> ſo to have
rais'd Contributions to the very Gates of <hi>Arras</hi>
and St. <hi>Omer,</hi> or that we ſhou'd have Bombarded
<hi>Tournay</hi> in our Retreat, or elſe have form'd the Siege
of <hi>Menin.</hi> There was a good Train of Artillery
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95918:39"/>
and Mortar Pieces, and a great quantity of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
ready at <hi>Sas van Ghendt,</hi> and it was ſaid Orders
were given to have them brought to us by Water
to <hi>Audenarde:</hi> But what hinder'd us from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
any thing more in the French Conqueſts, is
what we are now going to relate.</p>
            <p>After that the Biſhop and Chapter of <hi>Liege</hi> had
refus'd the Neutrality offer'd them by the Mareſchal
<hi>de Luxembourg,</hi> when he had taken the Frontier
Town of this Principality; the Mareſchal <hi>de Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg</hi>
made as if he deſign'd to force it to accept
of his Conditions; for which reaſon (as we have ſaid
before) the King detach'd 10 Battalions, under the
Command of Brigadier <hi>Swerin,</hi> to reinforce that
Gariſon, which now was ſo numerous, that it made
as conſiderable a Body as that we had within the
Lines, being about 17000 Men. <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> who
found the place in ſuch a condition of defence, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he could not force the Biſhop to a Neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
reſolv'd to Attack the King, who continu'd in
his Camp at <hi>Neerheſpen</hi> from the <hi>15th.</hi> to obſerve
the ſucceſs of <hi>Luxembourg</hi>'s Attempt upon <hi>Liege,</hi>
and who was very much weaken'd by the Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he had been oblig'd to put in <hi>Liege</hi> and <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricht,</hi>
for the ſecurity of thoſe places; ſo that His
Majeſty's Army was now reduc'd to 51 or 52 Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions:
And to cover his deſign with more ſecreſie,
<hi>Luxembourg</hi> order'd a great quantity of Faſcines to
be brought into his Camp, as if he had perſiſted in
the reſolution to Attack <hi>Liege,</hi> and at the ſame time
to ſend a Detachment to the <hi>Païs Conquis</hi> to make
a head againſt the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg;</hi> for which
reaſon the Count <hi>de Montchevreüil</hi> was order'd on the
<hi>16th.</hi> with a conſiderable Detachment both of Horſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95918:39"/>
and Foot to encamp a little way off, upon the Left
of their Army at <hi>Hellick,</hi> of which the King had
notice; whereupon the King continu'd encamp'd at
<hi>Neerheſpen,</hi> where we had greater plenty of Forage
than about <hi>Tillemont</hi> or <hi>Louvain.</hi> On the <hi>17th. Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg</hi>
deſign'd to march to Attack the King, and
<hi>Montchevreüil</hi> had orders to joyn him, but the Rain
that happen'd that day hinder'd his march. The
<hi>17th.</hi> in the Evening he gave Orders for Forrage, and
about Midnight the whole Army had Orders to pack
up Baggage, and to march forthwith in the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to come and Attack us in our Camp at <hi>Neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſpen,</hi>
diſtant ſix or ſeven Leagues from <hi>Hellick;</hi> and
<hi>Montchevreüil</hi> had Orders to joyn <hi>Luxembourg.</hi> The
Army march'd as ſoon as 'twas day upon four Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns,
the Foot upon two in the Center, and the
Horſe upon two in the Right and Left, for the
greater Expedition upon ſo long a March; and
ſo the Army paſs'd the <hi>Jecker,</hi> part about its Spring,
and part above between <hi>Warem</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> upon the
<hi>Mehaigne.</hi> The Mareſchal <hi>de Luxembourg</hi> at firſt had
put himſelf at the Head of the Left Wing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Mareſchal <hi>de Joyeuſe,</hi> which made
upon this March the Right Column. When
he was come as far as <hi>Warem,</hi> he learn'd by
his Spies that the Allies ſtill continued in their
Camp at <hi>Neerheſpen,</hi> and ſo order'd a halt to give
time to this Column to paſs the River <hi>Jecker.</hi> The
Mareſchal then left the Command of the Left Wing
to <hi>Joyeuſe,</hi> and advanced to the Right Wing,
Commanded by the Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> which made
the Left Column; and having march'd above the
Springs of the <hi>Jecker,</hi> was got before as far as <hi>Avernas,</hi>
whilſt the Foot paſs'd the <hi>Jecker</hi> upon ſeveral Bridges,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95918:40"/>
Commanded by the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi>
               <note place="margin">July 18.</note> the Duke of
<hi>Berwick,</hi> and <hi>Rubantel,</hi> Lieutenant Generals. <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg</hi>
advanc'd as faſt as he could with the King's
Houſhold, and the reſt of the Right Wing of Horſe,
to come in ſight of our Camp, to charge our Rear-Guard,
in caſe we had reſolv'd to repaſs the <hi>Geet,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Enemies approach; but <hi>Luxembourg</hi> found
that he was not to have ſo cheap a Bargain. From <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernas</hi>
he marched along the Plain, between the <hi>Geet</hi>
and <hi>Beck,</hi> and about four in the Afternoon he was
got as far as <hi>Reithoven</hi> in ſight of our Camp, and
forthwith poſted two Regiments of Dragoons in
the Villages of <hi>Gertruydenland</hi> and <hi>Overwinden,</hi>
which were ſoon after relieved by ſeveral Battalions
of <hi>Montchevreüil</hi>'s Detachment, which having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd
apart upon the Left the night before, was for
that reaſon more advanc'd than the reſt of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry
of their Army.</p>
            <p>The King, who ſtill continu'd in the Camp of
<hi>Neerheſpen</hi> to know the certainty of the Enemies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
before he went off farther from the <hi>Meuſe,</hi>
ſent out daily ſome Parties of Horſe to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
of the Enemy; and the ſame day that
<hi>Luxembourg</hi> came up to us, one of our Parties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
which gave His Majeſty an account that they
cou'd not go beyond <hi>Warem,</hi> becauſe they had met
there with a great Party of <hi>French</hi> Horſe, for which
reaſon they had gone no farther; which Body of Horſe
was indeed the Left Wing of their Army upon the
March. As ſoon as the King had notice of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
approach, he got on Horſeback, with the
Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and chief Officers of the Army.
His Majeſty found by the Enemies Countenance, that
'twas the Vanguard of their whole Army that was
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95918:40"/>
coming up to attack him in his own Camp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the King immediately order'd to Arms, and to
draw in Battel in order to expect the Enemy. And
this His Majeſty choſe, rather than expoſe his Rear
in repaſſing the <hi>Geet</hi> to the Enemies Charge, and to
certain ruine, and ſo to make the beſt advantage of
the Ground he had, and to venture a Battel, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the vaſt diſproportion between the two
Armies. Beſides, the <hi>French</hi> were now as near our
great and defenceleſs Towns of <hi>Brabant</hi> as we were,
unleſs their proceedings had been ſtopt by venturing
the Engagement: And as the advantages of a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
were great, ſo upon the worſe ſuppoſition of
the event, we had ſtill Prince <hi>Wirtemberg</hi>'s Army
ready to make up the Breaches of our own, an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
which the Enemy had not then ſo ready on
their ſide. Our Right in this Camp was at <hi>Heylyſſem</hi>
and <hi>Wangen</hi> upon the River <hi>Geet,</hi> and reach'd as far
as <hi>Neerwinden,</hi> being cover'd with a ſmall Brook,
ſeveral Hedges, and hollow ways. The Elector of
<hi>Bavaria</hi> had his Quarter at <hi>VVangen;</hi> the Body of
Foot, and Left Wing of Horſe reach'd from thence
as far as <hi>Dormal,</hi> upon the Brook of <hi>Beck,</hi> where
<hi>Lewe</hi> remain'd in our Rear.</p>
            <p>There are hereabouts two Rivers, both which
have the name of <hi>Geet,</hi> the Greater and the Leſs.
The Greater <hi>Geet</hi> comes from <hi>Iudoigne</hi> to <hi>Tillemont;</hi>
the Leſſer, which did run upon the Right and part
of the Rear of our Camp at <hi>Neerheſpen,</hi> has its Spring

River <hi>Rupel,</hi> about a League higher than <hi>Dieſt,</hi> from
whence 'tis conveyed by <hi>Arſchot</hi> and <hi>Mecklin</hi> to the
<hi>Scheld.</hi> About ſix in the Afternoon the Mareſchal
<hi>de Joyeuſe</hi> came up with the Left Wing of Horſe,
and the Body of Foot about eight of the Clock,
which for more expedition the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> had
order'd to march, after they had paſs'd the <hi>Jecker,</hi>
upon four Columns, with the beſt part of the Train
of Artillery. As 'twas then too late to begin ſo
great a Work as the Enemy had now in hand, <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg</hi>
contented himſelf to order the diſpoſition
of the Army to the ſeveral Poſts in order to begin
early the next day. For this end he poſſeſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of the Village of <hi>Landen</hi> upon his Right, where
he order'd the Marquis of <hi>Crequi</hi> Mareſchal de Camp,
with the Brigades of <hi>Bourbonnois</hi> and <hi>Lyonnois,</hi> to
which the Marquis of <hi>Feuquieres</hi> Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
joyn'd afterwards the Brigade of <hi>Maulevrier;</hi>
beſides, between this Village of <hi>Landen</hi> and that of
St. <hi>Gertrudenland,</hi> he order'd the Brigades of <hi>Navarre,
Anjou,</hi> and <hi>Artois,</hi> under the Command of the Count
<hi>de Solre</hi> Mareſchal de Camp, with the Dragoons of
<hi>Caylus</hi> and <hi>Finmarcon,</hi> and the Regiments of <hi>Asfeldt;
Berwick</hi> and <hi>Rubantel</hi> both Lieutenant Generals, the
Baron of <hi>Breſſey,</hi> and <hi>Sarsfield</hi> Lord <hi>Lucan,</hi> Mareſchals

of <hi>Piémont,</hi> the King's, <hi>Cruſſol, Orleans,</hi> and <hi>Reynold,</hi>
to the Village of <hi>High-VVinden,</hi> where they joyn'd
the Brigades of <hi>Salis</hi> and <hi>Arbouville,</hi> which had been
poſted here before by the Lieutenant General
<hi>Montchevreüil.</hi> Note, That the late King <hi>James</hi>'s
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95918:41"/>
Guards were in this Brigade of <hi>Arbouville,</hi> but not
being detach'd with <hi>Montchevreüil</hi> upon the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

ſome of the Brigades which were poſted upon the
Enemies Right at <hi>Landen,</hi> and between that and
St. <hi>Gertruydenland,</hi> of which we have now given an
account, and which afterwards charg'd us at <hi>Neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landen,</hi>
where they were vigorouſly repulſed; of
which more hereafter. Between theſe two Villages
where the foreſaid Infantry had been poſted, <hi>viz.
Landen</hi> and <hi>Overwinden, Luxembourg</hi> order'd a Line of
Horſe of 7 Squadrons of the Kings Houſe, of the Meſtre
de Camp or Colonel General of Horſe's Regiment, of
the Regiments of Dauphin Stranger, and that of
<hi>Bourbon,</hi> with the Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> and the Sieur
<hi>Rozen</hi> Lieutenant General, and the Duke of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quelaure</hi>
Mareſchal de Camp. He order'd a ſecond
Line, made up of the Brigades of French and Suiſs
Guards, and that of <hi>Guiche,</hi> Commanded by the
Prince of <hi>Conti:</hi> A third of Horſe, made up of the
reſt of the Houſhold, the Brigades of <hi>Bolen,</hi> Carabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers,
and the Regiment of <hi>Praſlin</hi> which remain'd
of the Meſtre de Camp Generals Brigade; The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis

Generals, the Duke of <hi>Elboeuf,</hi> and the Count
of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> Mareſchals de Camp, had the Command
of this Line. After, he order'd a fourth Line of Foot,
conſiſting of the Brigades of <hi>Vermandois, Zurbeck,</hi>
and <hi>Zurlaube</hi> Suiſſers, <hi>Nice,</hi> Royal <hi>Rouſſillon,</hi> and
<hi>la Sarre.</hi> The reſt of the Horſe, Commanded by
Lieutenant General <hi>Vateville,</hi> made up ſeveral other
Lines, as the Ground wou'd permit; and the whole
diſpoſition of the Horſe was made according to the
Orders received from the Duke of <hi>Chartres,</hi> who
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95918:42"/>
commanded it. The Chevalier <hi>de Bezons</hi> Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
de Camp, with the Reſerve, was poſted behind
the Village of <hi>Overwinden,</hi> and Lieutenant-General
<hi>Ximenes,</hi> and Mareſchal de Camp <hi>Pracontal</hi> were
commanded to the ſame place with ſeveral Brigades
of Horſe drawn both from the Right and from
the Left. The Reſerve was made up here with
three Squadrons of the Grand Mouſquetaires, the
Regiments of Dragoons of <hi>Bellegarde,</hi> St. <hi>Fremond,</hi>
St. <hi>Hermine,</hi> each conſiſting of four Squadrons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
two Battalions of the Fuziliers. This is the
Order in which the French Army remain'd this
Night.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Enemy drew up by our Camp,
the King order'd Brigadier <hi>Ramſey</hi> with his Brigade
then compos'd of five Battalions, <hi>viz. Offerrell, Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kay,
Lauder, Leven,</hi> and <hi>Monroe,</hi> to the Right of all
before our Right Wing of Horſe, to guard ſome
Hedges and hollow Ways which there cover'd our
Right juſt upon the Right of the Village of <hi>Laér.</hi>
The <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> Battalions were poſted at this Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
and to the Left of it, and more to the Leſt the
Infantry of <hi>Hanover.</hi> Prince Charles of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi>
as Major-General, commanded the ſix Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> and Lieutenant-General <hi>Du
Mont</hi> thoſe of <hi>Hanover,</hi> with whom he was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the Village of <hi>Neerwinden,</hi> that cover'd part
of our Camp between the Right Wing of Horſe
and our main Body. Theſe were afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforc'd
by the Firſt Battalion of the Firſt Regiment
of Guards, the Second Battalion of Dutch Guards,
and the Second Battalion of Scotch Guards. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Left at <hi>Neerlanden</hi> his Majeſty order'd the
Firſt Battalion of the Royal Regiment, <hi>Churchill</hi>'s,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95918:42"/>
               <hi>Selwyn</hi>'s, and <hi>Trelawney</hi>'s, Prince <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Battalion
of <hi>Danes,</hi> and <hi>Fagel</hi>'s, to poſſeſs this Vilage that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
the Left of our Body of Foot, which upon
the Enemies approach had wheel'd from the Left
to the Right, to bring up their Left to the Brook
of <hi>Beck,</hi> where 'twas cover'd by this Village of
<hi>Neerlanden.</hi> The Ground was open between <hi>Neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winden</hi>
and <hi>Neerlanden,</hi> whereupon his Majeſty or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
a Retrenchment to be made in the night
from the one to the other, to cover our Body of
Foot, which indeed was but a ſlight Breaſt-work, as
a Man may judge by the time they had to make,
and the number of Men that worked about it, <hi>viz.</hi>
30 Men <hi>per</hi> Battalion; and yet the French King
is pleas'd to call this, in his Letter to the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Paris,</hi> a <hi>formidable Retrenchment;</hi> which
Hyperbolical Epithet would certainly have been
more becoming a Poet's licencious way of writing,
who to render the leaſt things admirable is allowed
to heigthen their Idea's with pompous and high-flown
Epithets, than the Honour and Credit of a
King, who, one would think, ſhou'd be oblig'd in
ſuch a Caſe to the ſtricteſt Rules of Truth, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
when 'tis to ſet forth his own Praiſe. What
remain'd of the Body of Foot was drawn up in
one Line within this Retrenchment to defend it.
Our Dragoons upon the Left were order'd to the
Village of <hi>Dormal</hi> to guard that Paſs upon the
Brook of <hi>Beck,</hi> and from thence our Left Wing of
Horſe reached to <hi>Neerlanden,</hi> where 'twas cover'd
by this Brook, and from thence turn'd off to the
Right behind our Body of Foot, where it made as
'twere the Figure of an Elbow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:95918:43"/>
The King,<note place="margin">July 19.</note> who hitherto had been on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
continually till late in the Evening, to order
the diſpoſition of his Army, to viſit and ſecure the
Poſts that cover'd us, and to ſee how our Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
went on, at laſt order'd his Coach to be
brought up to the Rear of <hi>Stanley</hi>'s Regiment,
where his Majeſty went in to take a little reſt, and
at the ſame time to be ready upon every Occaſion.
The King repos'd in his Coach two or three hours,
and early in the morning his Majeſty, whoſe Piety
is as unparallel'd as his Valour, ſent for Doctor <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi>
one of his Chaplains, into the Coath to pray
with him ſuitably to the Occaſion, and to beg a
Bleſſing upon his Majeſty's Arms, but above all that
God would be pleas'd to preſerve his precious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
(as he had hitherto done in the moſt evident
Dangers) under the Wings of his Almighty and
Gracious Providence. And tho' the King, who is
Pious without Oſtentation or Hypocriſie, would
not have his Devotion publiſh'd out of his Cloſet,
yet I thought my ſelf oblig'd to publiſh this, for an
Example to our Officers and Soldiers, that they may
be ſenſible that the moſt Heroick Valour is that
which is grounded upon a good Conſcience, and a
true Chriſtian Piety; that they are mightily mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
who think that Piety at ſuch a time does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
a dejectedneſs and fear of Mind, (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is true in thoſe, who are never Pious but
then) and that Men cannot expreſs how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
and unconcern'd they are at ſuch an hour,
but by bellowing out their Oaths, and telling Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of their filthy and infamous Debaucheries.
Would to God his Majeſty's Forces would as readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
propoſe to themſelves the King's Example in this
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95918:43"/>
Caſe, as they are willing to follow him when he
leads them to engage their Enemies.</p>
            <p>At Sun-riſing we found the Enemies drawn up
within Cannon-ſhot, which then began to play up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them with good ſucceſs: They ſuſtain'd it
with an admirable Conſtancy, and tho' our Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
made great execution (being very well po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
upon ſeveral Batteries on the Right and Left,
and all along within the Retrenchment) yet the
Enemies Horſe remain'd as firm and immovable as
ſo many Rocks, without offering to make any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for about two hours together, till about ſix
of the Clock that they made a motion to draw
nearer to our Retrenchment, but they found our
Cannon ſo inconvenient, that they quitted the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the Plain, and made their Infantry march off
ſome to our Right towards the Villages of <hi>Neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winden</hi>
and <hi>Lare,</hi> and to our Left towards the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
of <hi>Neerlanden. Luxembourg,</hi> who found that
to make his way into our Camp he muſt firſt make
himſelf Maſter of the Villages of <hi>Lare</hi> or <hi>Noerwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
order'd about eight of the Clock the Attack
of this Left Village after this manner. Lieutenant-General
<hi>Rubantel</hi> commanded the Right of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
with the King's and <hi>Cruſſol</hi>'s Brigades: <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chevreüill</hi>
the Left with the Brigades of <hi>Salis, Suiſſers,</hi>
and <hi>Arbouville.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> the Center
with the Brigades of <hi>Piémont</hi> and <hi>Orleans.</hi> Theſe
three Lieutenant-Generals had under them Baron
<hi>Breſſey,</hi> and <hi>Sarsfield</hi> Lord <hi>Lucan,</hi> for Major-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.
Thus far the French Account. To ſuſtain
the Attack made by theſe ſix Brigades, as we have
before told it, we had only the ſix Battalions of
<hi>Hanover,</hi> and three of the Guards. The Sieur <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:95918:44"/>
had at the ſame time Orders to joyn the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
with his Brigade, and the Sieurs <hi>Ximenes</hi> and
<hi>Pracontal</hi> with their Body of Horſe, and to attack
the Village of <hi>Lare,</hi> where Brigadier <hi>Ramſey</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
with his five Battalions, beſides the Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of <hi>Churchill</hi> and <hi>Trelawney</hi> that had been ſent
off from the Left at <hi>Neerlanden</hi> (where they had
been poſted the night before) to re-inforce <hi>Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi>
upon the Right. The Enemy made their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
with all the Vigour poſſible, and the ſucceſs
was various for ſome time. The Firſt Battalion of
Guards was at firſt broken, and then rally'd again
with the Second, after the loſs of a great many Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
and Soldiers. The <hi>French</hi> were forc'd to
give way, but the Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi> came to their
relief with the Brigade of <hi>Guiche,</hi> which renew'd
their Vigour, and then ours on their ſide began to
make way. Brigadier <hi>Ramſey</hi> was attack'd very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly
with the whole Reſerve of Dragoons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the Regiment Colonel, that had re-inforc'd
it with <hi>Reynold</hi>'s Brigade. The <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions
who lin'd the Hedges and Way between
<hi>Lare</hi> and <hi>Neerwinden</hi> had their ſhare between theſe
two Attacks. The Diſpute was hot at <hi>Lare,</hi> and
the Fire very violent, but our People at laſt gave
way, by which the Enemy had the opportunity to
come in upon the Right and charge our Horſe, but
the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> received them with ſuch Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
that he drove them back again with a great
ſlaughter: Brigadier <hi>Ramſey</hi> rally'd his Brigade,
and they charg'd the Enemy that had poſſeſs'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of the Village of <hi>Lare</hi> with ſuch Fury that
they beat them out again, regain'd their Poſt, and
made great ſlaughter among the Enemies. The
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95918:44"/>
               <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> Battalions with Prince <hi>Charles</hi> became
again Maſters of their Poſt; and the King rallied
the <hi>Hanover</hi> and his own Battalions at <hi>Neerwinden,</hi>
and made them Charge the Enemy again, where
they had now, as appears by their own Account
which I have inſerted, ſeven Brigades; <hi>Cruſſoll,</hi> the
King's, <hi>Salis, Arbouville, Piémont, Orleans,</hi> and
<hi>Guiche,</hi> under the Command of three Lieutenant-Generals,
beſides the Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi> who had
come to the Relief with the laſt Brigade; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
our handful of rallied Men charg'd them
with ſuch Vigour, that they made them retreat, tho'
they cou'd not ſo entirely beat them out of this
Village, but that they continued Maſters of ſome of
the outermoſt Hedges. The French Account to
cover this, ſays, that we were then conſiderably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforc'd
both at <hi>Lare</hi> and <hi>Neerwinden</hi> from our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Foot; but 'tis certain there was no ſuch
thing; 'twas only the ſame Forces rally'd that had
the Credit of re-gaining their former Poſt, and of
beating back their numerous Enemies that had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
it from them. What remain'd of our Infantry
was but enough to line the Retrenchment that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
us to the Plain, and 'twas not thought fit to
bring one Battalion from thence to re-inforce our
Troops at <hi>Neerwinden,</hi> leſt we ſhould have left the
moſt dangerous way into our Camp open to the
Enemy. The Duke of <hi>Berwick,</hi> who had been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
buſie and eager at this Attack, puſh'd ſo far as to
fall in amongſt our Men with his Aid de Camp <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moughty:</hi>
They were undiſtinguiſh'd for ſome time,
till Brigadier <hi>Churchill</hi> came near, and heard them
curſing the <hi>Suiſſers</hi> for not having done their Duty.
The Brigadier remember'd <hi>Acmoughty</hi>'s Face, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95918:45"/>
tho' he did not ſee the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi>'s, yet by
<hi>Acmoughty</hi>'s Employment he gueſs'd at the Perſon,
and ſo made them both his Priſoners.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> tried their Fortune after this at <hi>Neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landen,</hi>
to ſee if they cou'd have better ſucceſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Left than they had upon our Right. The
King (as we have ſaid before) had in the morning,
ſent off from this Poſt the Battalions of <hi>Churchill</hi>
and <hi>Trelawney</hi> to re-inforce Brigadier <hi>Ramſey</hi> upon
the Right, ſo that there remain'd but four Battalions
for the Defence of this Place, <hi>viz.</hi> The Firſt Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
of the Royal Regiment, <hi>Selwyn</hi>'s, Prince <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>'s,
and <hi>Fagel</hi>'s. The four Regiments of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons
of <hi>Cailus, Finmarcon,</hi> and two of <hi>Asfeld</hi> had
paſs'd the Brook of <hi>Beck,</hi> between this and <hi>Landen,</hi>
to come and attack us upon our Flank in this Poſt.
The Marquis <hi>de Crequi,</hi> who commanded the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades
that had been poſted the overnight at <hi>Landen,</hi>
order'd them down to Charge us at the ſame time
in Front on this ſide of the Brook. The Brigades
were, <hi>Bourbonnois, Lyonnois, Anjou,</hi> and <hi>Artois,</hi> King
<hi>James</hi> his Guards being then amongſt them. 'Tis
true, the Poſt we had to defend was not weak; but
'twas attack'd with a great diſproportion of Forces,
and the Fire was very ſmart on both ſides. The
King, who was every where where there was any
Action, rid from the Right here to the Left as ſoon
as the Enemy attack'd this Poſt. The Firſt Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
of the Royal Regiment was after a ſharp di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute
forc'd to retire, but after ſuſtain'd by <hi>Selwin</hi>'s,
who obſerving a Paſſage in this place where Horſe
could come in upon his Rear, order'd Trees to be
cut down, and ſtop it up. We caus'd likewiſe that
Houſe to be ſet on fire, where <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95918:45"/>
had before been poſted: But both theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
were at laſt ſuſtain'd by Prince <hi>Frederick</hi>'s,
and <hi>Fagel</hi>'s, and after a ſharp Diſpute of about two
hours had the advantage; the Enemy were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
beaten off, and purſu'd quite out of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filé
into the very Plain, ſo that they attempted this
Place no more. The King, who was preſent moſt
part of the time with <hi>Selwyn</hi>'s Regiment, was an
Eye-witneſs of this Action, and beheld them pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
the Enemies. The French Account pretends
that we were beaten from this Poſt quite into our
Retrenchment, and that becauſe <hi>Luxembourg</hi> found
that this was not a place where Horſe cou'd paſs
into our Camp, he order'd them to leave it; but
the truth is they left it becauſe we beat them
from it.</p>
            <p>Hitherto the ſucceſs of the Day was viſibly on our
ſide, and both our Artillery and ſmall Shot had
done wonders. And the <hi>French</hi> who continu'd
ſtill a faint fire at <hi>Neerwinden</hi> ſeem'd to have their
Belly full. 'Tis ſaid that moſt of the General Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
were of Opinion to retire, but <hi>Luxembourg,</hi>
who had ſtill the Brigade of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Suiſſe</hi>
Guards, and the <hi>Suiſſe</hi> Brigades of <hi>Zurlaube</hi> and
<hi>Zurbeck,</hi> as a Reſerve of freſh Men, reſolv'd with
theſe to try t'other Onſet, and to ſee if they could
not carry the Village of <hi>Neerwinden</hi> by this their
very laſt effort. The Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> came at the
Head of theſe Brigades to make the Attack. The
Enemies had remain'd Maſters of the outermoſt
Hedges of this Village, as we have ſaid before, and
our rally'd Forces, tho' they had the advantage in
the laſt Charge to make the Enemy give way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably,
yet they could not intirely clear the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95918:46"/>
Village of them. The Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> with theſe
three freſh Brigades, and the beſt Foot the <hi>French</hi>
had in their Army, charged our People ſo vigorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(who had been engaged here from the beginning
to this time, which was now between two and
three of the Clock, and wearied with ſo long ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice)
that they were forced at laſt to give way,
and the <hi>French</hi> remained Maſters of the Avenues of
this Village. Immediately upon this ſucceſs the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal
<hi>de Luxembourg</hi> came to obſerve the Paſſages
that led to our Camp for the Horſe to march in. He
found a very narrow one; however the Mareſchal
<hi>de Villeroy</hi> undertook to bring in Horſe this way,
and ſo he order'd five Squadrons of the King's
Houſe to file off upon the Left (which was the
neareſt to the Paſs) to come into our Camp. The
Light-Horſe firſt, then the Gens d'Armes, and after
three Squadrons of Life-Guards. As this Body of
Horſe came into our Camp they extended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon their Left, and form'd their Squadrons
under their Infantry. Count <hi>d'Arco,</hi> General of
the Bavarian Curaſſiers, charged them with ſuch
Vigour that he repulſed them quite within their
Foot, notwithſtanding their brave reſiſtance. The
Duke of <hi>Chartres,</hi> who charged at the Head of the
French Horſe, found himſelf inviron'd with our
Forces, and narrowly eſcaped being made Priſoner.
'Twas then that we endeavour'd to regain once more
this Poſt of <hi>Neerwinden.</hi> The Elector upon the
Right, order'd two Battalions to Charge the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in Front, whilſt three others ſhould Charge
them upon their Left Flank, but the firſt Brigades
of <hi>Piemont,</hi> the King's, <hi>Cruſſol, Guiche, Arbouville,</hi> and
<hi>Orleans,</hi> upon the Advantage the Brigade of Guards
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95918:46"/>
and <hi>Suiſſers</hi> had now gained at this place, Rally'd
and reinforced them; ſo that the Attempt became
impoſſible; They fell upon two Battalions of <hi>Hanouer,</hi>
and made them quite give way. The two Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
one of <hi>Dutch</hi> and t'other of <hi>Scots</hi> Guards, which
the Elector had commanded to Charge the Enemy
in the Front, had ſpent all their Ammunitions by
their continual Fire for ſo many hours: The Elector
order'd to have Ammunition brought them, but it
could not come time enough to do buſineſs. The
King, who had left <hi>Neerlanden</hi> upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's
freſh Attempt upon this Place, led twice the
Engliſh Battalions to the Charge, up to the right
of the Retrenchment, which was now Flanked and
under the Enemy's Command, where they Fought
with very much bravery as they had done every
where elſe. In the mean while <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> who
had found a more convenient Paſſage for the Horſe
between the Poſts of the King's and <hi>Zurbeck</hi>'s Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades,
came in himſelf with the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi>
and the Count <hi>de Marſin</hi> into the Plain of our Camp,
with the Carabiniers and ſeveral other Regiments,
whilſt the Mareſchal <hi>de Joyeuſe</hi> and the Duke of
<hi>Bourbon</hi> (who had left the Brigade of <hi>Guiche</hi> to Poſt
himſelf upon his Wing of Horſe) paſs'd with the
Count <hi>Naſſau</hi> Mareſchal de Camp, more to his Left
between the Villages of <hi>Neerwinden</hi> and <hi>Lare,</hi> with
the Meſtre de Camp's Royal <hi>Rouſſillon,</hi> and Cuiraſſiers
Brigades. The firſt that had come in with <hi>Conti</hi> joyn'd
with the King's Houſe (that had Rally'd behind their
Foot where they had been repuls'd by the Count
<hi>d' Arco)</hi> and fell on upon the <hi>Hanouer</hi> Horſe, and
broke them. The Sieur <hi>Ximenes,</hi> the Count <hi>de Guiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card,</hi>
the Chevalier <hi>Bezons,</hi> and the Sieur <hi>Pracontal,</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:95918:47"/>
came in upon their Left, with part of the ſecond Line
of Horſe, and the Reſerve, along the Hedges of <hi>Lare.</hi>
The Marquis of <hi>Harcourt,</hi> who had been ſent for
from <hi>Huy</hi> with his Detachment of 22 Squadrons,
came time enough to have his ſhare of the day; He
joyn'd theſe, and made his Dragoons alight to chaſe
our Foot out of the Village of <hi>Laer.</hi> The Duke of
<hi>Villeroy</hi> came in upon our Right of the Retrenchment
with the Sieur <hi>Roſen,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de Feuquieres,</hi>
and the Sieur <hi>Buſca,</hi> Lieutenant-Generals, and the
Duke of <hi>Roquelaure,</hi> Mareſchal de Camp, with the
reſt of the King's Houſe; however, this Place was
diſputed with a great deal of Bravery by our Right
of the Engliſh Foot Poſted here. They were Flank'd
by the Enemy's Foot, now Maſters of the Village
of <hi>Neerwinden,</hi> and in Front by the Brigades of
<hi>Vermandois, Nice, Rouſſillon,</hi> and <hi>la Sare:</hi> They came
off and Rallyed ſeveral times, and went on again
with a great deal of Courage, notwithſtanding the
Enemy's continued Fire both Front and Flank; but
at laſt the Enemy overpower'd them ſo much, that
they remain'd Maſters of this part of the Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which they levell'd to make room for this
Body of Horſe to come in: However, they did not
come in upon ſo eaſy Terms, but that the firſt Troop
of Life-Guards, whereof the Mareſchal <hi>de Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi>
is Colonel, loſt their Standard, which was
taken by a Soldier of <hi>Talmaſh</hi>'s Battalion of Guards.
The Fuſiliers ſuffer'd very much in this Action.</p>
            <p>After the <hi>Hanover</hi> Horſe had been broken by the
Enemy, the reſt of our Right Wing of Horſe being
cut off from our Body of Foot, was ſoon overthrown
by them, who now had the opportunity to Charge
us both Front and Flank. The Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:95918:47"/>
did what he could to reſiſt the numerous Multitude
of the Enemy's Horſe that Charg'd him thus; but
finding it impoſſible, he, with the Advice of his
Generals, reſolved to Retreat, and made the Cuiraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers
by a Counter-march face the Enemy; but the
Enemy had already ſo far overpower'd them, that
the Retreat was difficult. The Enemy Charging on
all ſides, mingl'd themſelves with the Horſe that had
got to the River. The Elector with ſome difficulty
and hazard paſſed the Bridge, and Rally'd on t'other
ſide as many of our ſcatter'd Horſe and Foot as cou'd
get over, which did ſome Service to thoſe who were
ſtill on this ſide of the River ready to paſs. The
King did what he could to remedy this Diſorder in
our Right Wing of Horſe; he rid to the Left to
bring up the Engliſh Horſe for the relief of our Right:
But the Enemy, who were now Maſters of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment,
had got another Body of Horſe in our
Camp more, to their Right of <hi>Villeroy,</hi> under the
Command of the Duke <hi>d' Elboeuf</hi> Mareſchal de
Camp, followed by Lieutenant-General <hi>Vatteville,</hi>
with the Right of the Second Line. The Duke <hi>de
Montmorency,</hi> who hitherto had been with the
Mareſchal <hi>de Luxembourg</hi> his Father, repaired to his
Poſt here as Mareſchal de Camp, and put himſelf at
the Head of the Brigades of <hi>Rotembourg</hi> and <hi>Preſle;</hi>
theſe fell upon the Right Flank of the Dutch Horſe,
and put them in diſorder before that the Engliſh
Horſe which were led on by the King, could come
up and form their Squadrons; ſo that they were
forc'd to Charge the Enemy in the ſame order they
rid up to them, and moſt of them had rid as faſt
as the Horſe could Gallop; however, that did not
hinder ſeveral of them from doing extraordinary
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95918:48"/>
Service that day. The King Charg'd at the Head of
them himſelf, and <hi>Luxembourg</hi>'s Account ſays the
ſame thing of his Majeſty, that he Fought at the
Head of my Lord <hi>Galloway</hi>'s Regiment, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
its ſelf very much this day. Colonel
<hi>Wyndham</hi> Charg'd ſeveral times through and through
the Enemy's Squadrons. Colonel <hi>Langſton</hi> was made
Priſoner. The Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> Charged at the
Head of one of Brigadier <hi>Lumley</hi>'s Squadrons, that
had the opportunity to form it ſelf in Order, and
Fought amongſt the thickeſt of the Enemies with
an incomparable Bravery, ſuch as became the Son
of the Great <hi>Oſſory,</hi> and the Heir of the Virtues
as well as of the Wealth of a Family of Hero's.
His Horſe (as he was Ingaged in the crowd of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies)
was ſhot under him, and a Villain was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
to Stab him, which he already had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
by a puſh of his Sword down the upper
part of his Breaſt, after he had firſt cut him upon the
Wriſt; when a Generous Enemy (a Gentleman of
the French King's Guards) perceiving ſuch an air of
Virtue and Quality, rid up and ſtopt the bloody
Villain's Hand, and asked his Name and Quality, of
which he gave immediate notice to the Duke
<hi>d' Elboeuf,</hi> who (as we have now ſaid) Headed
the Horſe in this place. He received the Duke of
<hi>Ormond</hi> with very great Civility, gave him the ableſt
Surgeons to dreſs him, and ſent him in his Coach
to his Quarter.</p>
            <p>The King, who ſaw now that the French Horſe
was got in every where, that they had overthrown
our Right Wing which already paſs'd the River in
great diſorder, and that 'twas impoſſible to reſiſt,
order'd our Infantry to retreat to <hi>Dormal</hi> upon the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95918:48"/>
Brook of <hi>Beck,</hi> which Poſt had hitherto been kept
by the Dragoons of the Left Wing, who had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do this day: The Left of this Wing of
Horſe paſs'd at <hi>Oſmal</hi> a little below, and ſo they
went by the King's Orders to <hi>Lewe.</hi> The King, who
had ſtay'd ſo long to give Orders for the Retreat
till he found that the Enemies were ſurrounding him
on all ſides, and had already taken ſeveral Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
almoſt by his Majeſty's Perſon, reſolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
the River at the Bridge that had been made at
<hi>Neerheſpen.</hi> 'Twas with very great difficulty that
the King gained this Paſs. There was now nothing
but Confuſion and Diſorder in our Camp; all thoſe
which could not get the Paſſes for the Retreat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
preſſed by the Enemy, were forced to fling
themſelves into the River in our Rear; this was
the fate of our Right Wing of Horſe, and part of
the Left, and of the Foot that had Ingaged at
<hi>Neerwinden</hi> and <hi>Lare,</hi> where the Enemy had cut
off the Communication with our Left. A great
many of both Horſe and Foot were drowned in
the River, where the oppoſite Banks were generally
ſo very ſteep and high, that when they were got
to t'other ſide, yet even then they found 'twas very
difficult for them to ſave themſelves, eſpecially the
Horſe: My Lord of <hi>Athlone</hi> narrowly eſcap'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
drowned. The Cannon and Artillery Waggons
made up ſo faſt to the Paſſes upon the River, that
they meeting from all ſides, (beſides Horſe and Foot)
were generally ſo wedged in, that 'twas almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to get either one way or t'other, which
is the reaſon that ſo many of our Cannon were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and only that eſcaped which went off with the
Infantry by <hi>Dormal</hi> to <hi>Lewe.</hi> If the Enemy's Horſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95918:49"/>
were ſo brisk to Charge thoſe who could retreat no
where but by the River, where our People were in
the greateſt Confuſion imaginable, they were as
cautious to meddle with thoſe who could obſerve
the leaſt Order in their Retreat. Lieutenant-General
<hi>Talmaſh</hi> had the care to bring off the Engliſh Foot
of the main Body by <hi>Dormal,</hi> which he did with
as much Prudence as he had before fought with
Bravery in the unequal diſpute of the Retrenchment,
where he had a Horſe ſhot under him. He had Sir
<hi>Henry Bellaſis</hi> Major-General along with him, who
ſignaliz'd himſelf very much this day. As the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
offer'd to trouble his Retreat, he made the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions
face, and Preſent to them, and then they
halted, unwilling to feel any more the fire of our
Foot, and thus he brought them off ſafely to <hi>Lewe;</hi>
this is the cauſe that ſo many Battalions of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Forces of the Body of Foot ſuffer'd ſo little
that day. When the King had paſſed the River at
<hi>Neerheſpen,</hi> he joyn'd part of his Foot Guards, and
of the Horſe of the Left Wing, and what had paſſed
of <hi>Ramſey</hi>'s Brigade, with which he joyned the
Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and thoſe Forces that he had
brought off along with him, and retreated to <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techem</hi>
near <hi>Tillemont;</hi> and the reſt of the Army
that had retreated by <hi>Dormal</hi> to <hi>Lewe,</hi> marched on,
and Incamp'd at <hi>Dieſt.</hi> There were ſome whom the
diſorder of the day ſent as far as <hi>Breda.</hi> All our
Baggage had been ſent to <hi>Lewe</hi> the over-night,
where 'twas ſafely brought off in reſpect of the
Enemy, but generally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Plunder'd by our own People.
As ſoon as the King came to his Quarters that Night
at <hi>Boutechem,</hi> notwithſtanding the perpetual Fatigues
of the day, and that he had been on Horſeback from
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95918:49"/>
Three in the Morning, yet he diſpatched Thirty Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
with his own hand to the ſeveral Princes
and States our Allies, to give them notice of what
had happen'd, one to the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> who
was then Incamp'd almoſt under the Walls of <hi>Liſle,</hi>
where we have left him. A Man may ſafely chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
Hiſtory to produce all its Hero's, and ſee, not
only if any King, but if any General has ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
his Perſon ſo much as his Majeſty did this
day, who ſhared the hazards of it equally with any
Officer or Soldier in the Army. His Majeſty was
every where, where there was any Action in the
midſt of the Enemy's Fire, both with the Horſe
and with the Foot, whom he led on himſelf ſeveral
times to the Enemy, and all this while without Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
which the King would not put on to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
able to reſiſt the Fatigues and Labours of the
day, which his Majeſty foreſaw would be very great;
and 'twas a Special or rather Miraculous effect of
the goodneſs of God that then preſerved his Majeſty,
which can never be too much acknowledg'd by
his People. The King narrowly miſſed three Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
ſhots, one through his Periwig, which made
him deaf for a while; another through the Sleeve
of his Coat, which did no harm; the third car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
off the Knot of his Scarf, and left a ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
on his Side. His Majeſty got this day even
the Reſpect and Admiration of his Enemies, who
proclaimed louder his Majeſties Heroick Valour than
we can do our ſelves. 'Twas the common ſaying
amongſt them, That they wanted but ſuch a King
to make them Maſters of Chriſtendom. The Prince
of <hi>Conti,</hi> in his intercepted Letter to the Princeſs
his Wife, mentions, that he ſaw the King every
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95918:50"/>
where preſent where there was any Action, exp<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſing
himſelf to the greateſt dangers, and that ſo much
Valour deſerved very well the quiet poſſeſſion of
the Crown he wore. I do not ſay this out of a
principle of Flattery; His Majeſty is above it, and I
ſo much below, that the moſt I can ſay cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to it; but I have ſaid this only to diſabuſe
many of the King's good Subjects, who may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon by ill minded malicious People. I dare
ſay, not only that no General, but even no Officer
nor private Sentinel, can be produced out of ancient
or modern Hiſtory, that for his Age has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to ſo many dangers as the King, that has ſeen
ſo many Warlike Actions, and that has been preſent
at ſo many Battels and Sieges, and therefore 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a wonderful bleſſing of God, and a ſingular
token of the Care he takes of his Majeſty's Perſon,
that his Majeſty has hitherto eſcaped: So that we
may reaſonable expect, that as God had ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
rais'd him to a Throne, ſo he will ſtill preſerve
him for ſome greater Work; and that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the preſent proſperity of the Enemy's Arms, yet
he is ſtill reſerv'd (when once our Sins will not be
more prevalent than our Arms) for a Curb to check
the French Power and Greatneſs, and to protect his
People. As ſoon as <hi>Luxembourg</hi> was Maſter of our
Camp, he contented himſelf to purſue his Victory
no farther than the Banks of the River in our Rear,
and the beſt part of our Foot had retreated in Order
(as we have ſaid before) in ſpight of their Succeſs,
to <hi>Lewe.</hi> When the Camp remained clear, and that
moſt of our Troops had repaſs'd the River, the
Mareſchal <hi>de Luxembourg</hi> order'd the Cannon that
had been taken from us to be drawn upon a Line,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95918:50"/>
which was fir'd thrice in token of their Victory;
their ſmall Shot, both Horſe and Foot drew up, and
did the ſame, and remain'd encamp'd about <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
that night. <hi>Luxembourg</hi> diſpatched poſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
Monſieur <hi>d' Artagnan</hi> to the French King, to
let him know the advantage he had got over our
Army; for which good News the French King gave
him the Government of <hi>Arras,</hi> vacant by the death
of Lieutenant General Count <hi>de Montchevreüil</hi> kill'd
in this Engagement. He likewiſe order'd the <hi>Te
Deum</hi> to be ſung in the Cathedral Church of <hi>Noſtre
Dame</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> and writ the following Letter to the
Arch-Biſhop of the Place; which, for the Pomp and

attacked in its own Camp the <hi>29th.</hi> of the laſt Month,
by my Couſin the Mareſchal <hi>Duc de Luxembourg,</hi> in
purſuance of the Orders I had given him. The Enemies,
who did foreſee his deſign, left nothing undone that could
ſecure them; and tho' their Camp was already very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
by its ſituation, yet they had fortified it with
<hi>Formidable Retrenchments,</hi> and with an <hi>Incredible

either taken by force or left by the dying Men. There
is nothing but what my Enemies ought to fear after ſo
terrible a Defeat; there is nothing but what I have a
right to expect, but I reſtrain all my Wiſhes to the

great a Victory, but that my Enemies may at laſt open
their Eyes, and prove attentive to their true Intereſt,
and think of a ſolid and durable Peace, which I have

            <p>Tho' the advantage the <hi>French</hi> had this day was
conſiderable enough to order the Arch-Biſhop of
<hi>Paris</hi> to ſing the <hi>Te Deum</hi> in his Cathedral Church,
yet Truth is ſtretched to ſuch a heighth in it, that
the Stile of it is altogether Romantick. 'Tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable,
that the French King ſays in this Letter,
<hi>That our Army was Commanded by the King in Perſon,</hi>
which is as much as to ſay; That the King generouſly
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95918:51"/>
expos'd his Perſon in all the dangers of the day,
when <hi>Luxembourg</hi> attack'd his Army; but the French
King's Imperious Greatneſs would not allow him to
do the King Juſtice in ſo explicit Terms. Next, the
Letter ſays, that we had foreſeen the deſign, and
had omitted nothing that was neceſſary for our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
that tho' the ſituation of our Camp was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
advantageous, yet we fortified it with a <hi>Formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Retrenchment,</hi> and <hi>an Incredible Work,</hi> and
that nevertheleſs we were forced in it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a Man that knows nothing elſe of the Matter,
would think by this, that the Allies had known of
the deſign at leaſt ſeveral days before hand, and
that they had been all this time fortifying themſelves
in their Camp, in order to a vigorous reſiſtance;
nay, that they had almoſt as good Works as thoſe
about a Fortified Town to cover them, elſe what
is the meaning of <hi>Formidable Retrenchments,</hi> and <hi>an
Incredible Work?</hi> and yet it appears by their own
Relation ſent to Court (of which the French King
was not therefore ignorant) that when firſt they
came in preſence of our Camp, 'twas open, and had
no other ſtrength but what the nature of the ground
afforded, and that the Retrenchment was made in
very few hours in the night before the Engagement;
and 'tis certain, the order was but for 30 Men <hi>per</hi>
Battalion to work at it; Let any Man judge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whether in five hours time at moſt they could
make a <hi>Retrenchment</hi> ſo <hi>formidable</hi> as 'tis here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented.
But the advantage they have had over
us, wanted reality to make it ſo great a Victory,
and therefore the Author of the Letter has ſupply'd
it with words. As for the particulars of our Loſſes,
as Colours, Standards, Kettle-Drums, Cannon, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95918:52"/>
and Pontons, for the moſt part 'tis but an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
advantage, and, ſo far as there is a real loſs
in it, 'tis what can be eaſily recover'd; but all the
Soldiers, the brave Generals, and other good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
which the Freach King has loſt this day, is what
he cannot ſo ſoon recover, and here his loſs does
very much exceed ours. And now therefore is
there ſo much reaſon to ſay, that there is nothing
<hi>but what the Allies have reaſon to fear from him, after
ſo terrible a defeat?</hi> The latter end of the Campagne
is a ſufficient teſtimony to the contrary. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
to comfort the Allies in their Loſſes, his moſt
Chriſtian Majeſty is very compaſſionate, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
ſo great an advantage, which gives
him reaſon to hope every thing, yet he expreſſes
the greateſt tenderneſs imaginable for their <hi>Intereſt,</hi>
and deſires no <hi>other Fruits of ſo great a Victory, but
that the Allies would be made ſenſible of their true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi>
(which ſo far I pray God they may) and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the ſentiments of a <hi>ſolid and durable Peace,</hi>
which he had ſo often <hi>offer'd to them in the midſt</hi> of
his Victories; that is, for all <hi>Europe</hi> to put on his
Fetters, which indeed is the way to make a laſting
Peace when no body ſhall be able to reſiſt him.
This kindneſs for the Allies <hi>Intereſt</hi> (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>ſo great a Victory)</hi> is, I ſuppoſe, the reaſon why
after our Defeat, and that our Army, as his Letter
ſays, was intirely diſpers'd, yet the French King
would not take <hi>Bruſſels, Louvain,</hi> and <hi>Malines,</hi> &amp;c.
which <hi>now</hi> (if our Army was diſpers'd) did lye
open and defenceleſs to his victorious Forces; that
likewiſe he did not inſult the City of <hi>Liege,</hi> which
had ſo Inſolently refus'd the Neutrality; and that
he has only Beſieged <hi>Charleroy</hi> after ſo great an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95918:52"/>
which place we were not in a capacity to
relieve, whether we had fought or no. This is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to convince Impartial Men, that the Victory
was far from being ſo great and ſo advantageous in
reality, as 'tis in this Letter to the Arch-Biſhop,
wherein there is more of the <hi>Te Regem</hi> than <hi>Te
Deum Laudamus,</hi> which at laſt only comes in by the by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luxembourg</hi>'s Letter to the French King, ſent by
Monſieur <hi>d' Artagnan,</hi> as it has been publiſhed, is a
piece much of the ſame Stile, only he gives the Allies
their due commendation, ſaying, That they did
Wonders: But this comes in only to Inhance the
Glory of the Victory, and to paſs a greater Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment
upon his Forces, who, as he ſays, did better,
<hi>(i. e.)</hi> did more than thoſe who did Wonders in
their defence: It ſhould rather have been ſaid, that
they were double the number, and by that means
overpower'd the bravery of their Enemies. He adds,
That the Princes of the Blood out did themſelves in
this Action; that as for his part, he had no other
ſhare in the Action, but only to take <hi>Huy,</hi> to attack
the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and to beat him (which is as
much as to ſay, that all this is no great matter for the
Mareſchal <hi>de Luxembourg)</hi> as His Majeſty had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
Commanded him: But not a word of God,
nor the leaſt expreſſion of Thankfulneſs to him for
the Victory. If we read former Hiſtories, we ſhall
find as great Hero's that have done as great Exploits,
but have been more humble in their ſucceſs. The
<hi>French</hi> make their loſs very little and inconſiderable,
about 2000 kill'd, and 3000 wounded; but that
the Allies had about 20000 Men Kill'd, Wounded,
and Priſoners; but I believe 'twill appear by and
by, that when they reckon'd our Loſſes, 'twas ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95918:53"/>
their own, and that if we tranſpoſe them,
'twill be near the truth of the matter. 'Tis certain,
that we have taken from them 19 Colours, and 37
Standards, which, conſidering the proportion of
Forces, is more than they gain'd from us, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
as to the number of Colours; for beſides, that
the French had double our number of <hi>Foot,</hi> that
their Battalions never have but three Colours at the
moſt in each, our <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> and <hi>Hanouer</hi> Foot
have as many Colours as there are Companies in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Battalion, inſomuch that ſome Battalions have
a dozen; and therefore 'tis more for us in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to have taken 19 Colours from them, than if
they had taken 50 from us; by which the Reader
may judge which ſuffer'd moſt this day, the French
Infantry or ours. They have had a prodigious num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Officers Kill'd and Wounded, of all ſorts and

Captain <hi>Acmoughty,</hi> one of his <hi>Aides de Camp,</hi> and

they had at <hi>Dinant, Charlemont,</hi> and other places,

at <hi>Namur</hi> and <hi>Huy,</hi> were every day marching back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and forwards to Burials; and the Drums did
not beat at <hi>Namur,</hi> either for the retreat, or mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or relieving of the Guard for three Weeks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95918:54"/>
Every Window in the Town, if open, had
two or three Night-Caps at it, which were Officers
drawn thither in their Chairs to take a little Air. This
is what I have had from a worthy Gentleman, that
was both Wounded and Priſoner amongſt them, and
I give the very words he was ſo kind to ſend to me
in a Letter. So that of theſe 5000 of the Enemies
Kill'd and Wounded, it appears that above half the
number were Officers; and let any body judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there was no more of the Soldiers; nay rather,
how many Soldiers muſt be both Kill'd and Wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
when they had above 2000 Officers of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
But what is an unanſwerable argument of the
greatneſs of the Enemies loſs, notwithſtanding their
Relations, is that <hi>Luxembourg</hi> retreated the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
to <hi>Warem,</hi> where he remained without the
leaſt attempt for fifteen days together; and yet ſhall
the World believe, that we loſt 20000 Men, and
they ſo inconſiderable a number, when they were
twice as ſtrong as we before the Engagement? and
that our Army, as they ſaid, ſhould be diſpers'd,
and yet that they would not purſue their Victory
by ſome conſiderable Attempt, as on <hi>Bruſſels, Louvain,</hi>
or rather <hi>Liege,</hi> that had diſobliged them ſo much
by rejecting the Neutrality? and yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this great Defeat, and diſperſion of the Allies,
we find that <hi>Luxembourg</hi> Encamp'd very peaceably
at <hi>Warem,</hi> within four ſmall Leagues of this City,
without offering the leaſt violence to it; whereby
it appears, that the Allies do the French no wrong,
when they compute their loſs to be about 17000
Men kill'd and wounded; and that the beſt part
of their Infantry was ſhatter'd and broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:95918:54"/>
As for the loſs on our ſide, 'twas far from being
ſo great as at firſt apprehended; for the paſſage of
the River had put our Troops in ſuch confuſion, that
for the firſt four or five days after the Fight, it made
our loſs appear far greater than really it was. As for
what loſs we really ſuſtain'd the River kill'd as many,
if not more men, than the Enemy; 'tis certain that
'twas the deſtruction of many more Horſes, for the
Banks were generally ſo high on the oppoſite ſide, that
the Horſes cou'd not get out, and the Riders thought
themſelves happy if they cou'd get off, and leave
the Horſes to the mercy of the Water. We have
found by the review made after the joyning of our
Troops from the ſeveral places they had retreated
to, that we miſs'd but between 5 and 6000 fighting
Men kill'd, wounded and taken Priſoners; that we
loſt 2700 Horſes either kill'd, or taken by the Enemy,
or drown'd in the River. We had ſeveral both Men
and Women drown'd in the River that were Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
on the Army, as Servants, Soldiers Wives, and
Sutlers; and if the <hi>French</hi> will have them put in the
number of our loſſes, 'twill not yet amount to half
their ſumm of 20000 Men. I will not conteſt their
reckoning of our Cannon, Mortars, Pontons, Colours
and Standards, becauſe I have not ſeen our own Liſt
of it; but if they have taken ſo many Cannon, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
and Pontons, they may thank the River <hi>Geet</hi> for
it. The chief Officers kill'd were, the Prince of

                  </p>
                  <p>We have ſaid before that the King after the Fight
of <hi>Landen,</hi> or <hi>Neerwinden,</hi> (for ſo 'tis differently
call'd) had retreated with what Forces, both Horſe
and Foot, he had rally'd on to'ther ſide of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
where he joyned the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> with
the Troops he had rally'd.<note place="margin">20th.</note> The next day the King
marched on to <hi>Louvain,</hi> and the <hi>21th.</hi> he Incamped
at <hi>Eppeghem,</hi> our Right at <hi>Burntbridge,</hi> upon the
Road to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and our Left near <hi>Malines.</hi> The
Elector with the Spaniſh Troops came nearer <hi>Bruſſels,</hi>
and Incamp'd at <hi>Scarbeck.</hi> The <hi>24th.</hi> the Infantry
that had retreated by <hi>Leuwe</hi> to <hi>Dieſt</hi> with what Horſe
had followed them, joyned us here, Commanded by
Lieutenant-General <hi>Talmaſh,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Bellaſſis</hi> Major-General,
and Brigadier <hi>Churchill</hi> under him. Some
few who had gone as far as <hi>Breda,</hi> came up about
the ſame time, and now we found that we had not
ſuffer'd ſo much as 'twas at firſt imagin'd.</p>
                  <p>We have left Prince <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> with the Body
under his Command, Incamp'd at <hi>Anapes</hi> within two
ſmall Engliſh Miles of <hi>Liſle;</hi> but before we bring him
off from thence, we muſt not forget to mention that
he order'd a Ducat <hi>per</hi> Man to be diſtributed to all
the Pikemen that carried Faſcines at the Attack of
the Lines, to all the Granadiers, and beſides to all
thoſe who had the Van Guard at the Attack of
<hi>Pont a Treſein,</hi> whereby ſeveral Soldiers had two
Ducats in their Pockets to comfort them in their
Fatigues, which incourag'd them very much. On
the <hi>20th.</hi> the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> gave Orders for the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95918:58"/>
Army to march early in the Morning,<note place="margin">July.</note> and repaſs the
<hi>Marck</hi> at <hi>Pont a Treſein.</hi> 'Twas then ſuppoſed we
were going upon ſome farther Enterprize, and the
<hi>French</hi> were ſo jealous of <hi>Menin,</hi> that Monſieur <hi>de
Vauban</hi> had been order'd there to aſſiſt Monſieur
<hi>Pertuys</hi> in the defence of it, but 'twas rather believ'd
we were going to chaſe the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Courtray,</hi>
who ſtill kept that part of the Town ſituated on
the other ſide of the <hi>Lys,</hi> and to have fortified it for
a Winter Quarter. As <hi>Pont a Treſein</hi> is a very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
and narrow Paſs, and that we left one of the
Enemy's beſt Gariſons in our Rear, ſo Prince <hi>VVir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg</hi>
was very circumſpect in the ordering of it;
our Vanguard went off firſt, then the Baggage, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
Pontons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Infantry march'd in Battel;
the Front made the Flank towards the Enemy where
all the Officers marched; in the mean while our
Rear-guard of Horſe drew up their Squadrons in the
Plain, fronting <hi>Liſle;</hi> three or four pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
were order'd to remain at the Bridge for the
defence of it. Our Van-guard and Quarter-maſters,
juſt as they had paſs'd the Bridge met with a Party of
60 Horſe of the Enemy's, and they took moſt of them
Priſoners with their Horſes: in this order we repaſs'd
the Bridge. The Cannon order'd there came off
with the Rear-guard, and when they were all paſs'd
except one or two Squadrons, ſome Squadrons of
the Enemies rid down full ſpeed upon them, (theſe
had been ſent out of <hi>Liſle</hi> on purpoſe) but 'twas
too late; they did us no other harm; but they put
the laſt Squadron in diſorder by their ſo great haſte in
getting over. Not long after we had repaſſed <hi>Pont
a Treſein,</hi> the Duke of <hi>VVirtemberg</hi> had an Expreſs
from the King, that the <hi>French</hi> were come before
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95918:58"/>
his Camp, and that the Armies were juſt going to
Ingage, and ſo we march'd to our former Camp of
<hi>Eſquermes</hi> near <hi>Tournay,</hi> where in the Evening the
Duke had a Letter from the King, which gave him
an account of our Defeat at <hi>Landen,</hi> and withal,
order'd him to make all the haſte he could to joyn
him; whereupon Prince <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> made the next
day a very great march from <hi>Eſquermes,</hi> within a mile
and a half of <hi>Tournay,</hi> to <hi>Peleghem,</hi> about the ſame
diſtance from <hi>Audenarde,</hi> which is in all about ſix
Leagues march. We repaſs'd the Lines at <hi>Pont d'
Eſpiers.</hi> We found that the Boars had pull'd down
the Line all along, and ruin'd the Fortification of
this place. The <hi>22th.</hi> the Prince march'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd
the <hi>Scheld</hi> at <hi>Audenarde,</hi> and Incamp'd that day
at <hi>Aldereghem,</hi> on the little River <hi>Swalme,</hi> that falls
not far from hence into the <hi>Scheld.</hi> The <hi>23th.</hi> he
made another great march to reach to <hi>Aloſt,</hi> where
he Incamp'd that Night. Orders were given to
march the next day to joyn the King as ſoon as
poſſible; but that night the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi>
had an Expreſs from the King to let him know that
there was no neceſſity of preſſing his march; that
he found his Army in a better condition than he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
and ſo order'd him to remain there till he
ſhould repaſs the Canal of <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> We left the
two Walloon Regiments in their Gariſon of <hi>Aude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narde:</hi>
One or two of ours were ſent into Gariſon,
but afterwards countermanded, ſo that Prince <hi>Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg</hi>
had a Body of about 40 Squadrons and 24
Battalions ready to reinforce the King's Army, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he had brought from thence no more than 13
Battalions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:95918:59"/>
Tho' the <hi>French</hi> were not in a condition (after
they had ſo much boaſted their Victory, and that
our Troops, as they ſaid, were totally routed and
diſpers'd) to do us any harm either in <hi>Liege</hi> or <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant;</hi>
yet becauſe they would make ſome noiſe after
it, the Mareſchal <hi>de Luxembourg</hi> detach'd Lieutenant-General
<hi>Roſen</hi> with 10000 Horſe to go and make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions
in the Mayerie of <hi>Bois le duc,</hi> and raiſe Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions
upon the States Country on this ſide of
the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> but the King took care he ſhould not
go ſo far. Upon the firſt notice he detached my
Lord of <hi>Athlone</hi> with about 7000 Horſe, to march
that way. Baron <hi>Lubeck,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi>
Troops between the <hi>Rhine</hi> and the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> had
orders to advance between <hi>Aix la Chappelle</hi> and <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricht,</hi>
to be ready to paſs that River and joyn the
Earl of <hi>Athlone;</hi> upon which Lieutenant-General
<hi>Roſen</hi> retreated to the Army, after he had rais'd
Contributions only in the County of <hi>Horne,</hi> and
ſome neighbouring Villages of the Mayerie of <hi>Bois
le duc:</hi> And then the Earl of <hi>Athlone</hi> had orders
to come back to our Army.</p>
                  <p>Prince <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> remained ſtill in his Camp at
<hi>Aloſt,</hi> expecting the King's Orders to march, which
he received the <hi>31th.</hi> in the Night, and the next
day he march'd towards the Canal, and Incamp'd
between <hi>Mertom</hi> and <hi>Mellem.</hi> The day following
<hi>Auguſt</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> both Armies marched, the King paſs'd
the Canal with his at <hi>Vilvorde,</hi> and ſo we joyned
at <hi>VVemmel,</hi> where the King took his Quarter. Our
Right reach'd beyond <hi>Grimberg,</hi> and our Left at
<hi>Lacker.</hi> The Elector with the Spaniſh Troops,
marched from <hi>Scarbeck,</hi> paſſed the Canal at <hi>Lacker,</hi>
and Incamp'd upon our Left at the Abby of <hi>Dilleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem.</hi>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:95918:59"/>
And now our Army after this junction was
ſtronger by many Battalions than it had been all this
Campagne.<note place="margin">Auguſt.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Myn Heer <hi>Heynſius,</hi> Penſionary of <hi>Holland,</hi> and
Deputy from the States-General of the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
came to this Camp to wait upon the King,
and to congratulate his ſafe Deliverance from thoſe
many and great Dangers to which he expos'd his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Perſon for our common ſafety. He brought along
with him Bills for two Millions of Guilders, which the
States-General ſent to his Majeſty as a Token of the
intire Satisfaction and Confidence they had in him.
He had orders likewiſe to aſſure the King, that they
were ready to venture the very laſt Stake for the
defence of their Liberties under his Majeſty's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
and that they would unanimouſly concur to
increaſe their Forces both by Land and Sea, ſo as to
be able to check for the future, the exorbitant Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of our Enemies. And this was the States reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
when we thought our ſelves that our Affairs
were in a far worſe poſture than we found them
afterwards; for which generous Reſolution they can
never be too much commended, and for the great
Reſpect and Affection they have expreſs'd in this
occaſion to his Majeſty. Major-General <hi>Zuyleſtein,</hi>
who had been Priſoner at <hi>Namur</hi> ſince the laſt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
came likewiſe to this Camp; and I cannot omit
the great Compliment and Civility he receiv'd from
the Mareſchal <hi>de Luxembourg;</hi> who, when <hi>Zuyleſtein</hi>
took his leave of him to come to our Camp, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
the greateſt Reſpect for the Perſon of our
Monarch; and we may ſay, that the King's Heroick
Valour was ſo ſignally conſpicuous that day, that he
Conquer'd the very hearts and affections of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95918:60"/>
who unanimouſly proclaimed his Praiſe and
Commendation. 'Twas <hi>Luxembourg</hi>'s expreſſion to
<hi>Zuyleſtein,</hi> That their two Maſters deſerv'd to ſhare
the World between them.</p>
                  <p>On the <hi>5th.</hi> the King review'd the Army, which
drew out of the Camp upon two Lines; and as it
would have been too much work for one day to
have view'd the Regiments by ſingle Companies,
as the King rid by the Commiſſaries took only an
Account of the Number and Depth of the Files in
each Regiment, and the whole Army appear'd in a
very good condition, and ſtronger than it had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
been this Campagne. The ſame day three
Battalions were detach'd to <hi>Charleroy</hi> for the rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement
of that Gariſon, under the command of
the Marquis <hi>de Caſtillo,</hi> General of the Spaniſh Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
who was ſent to command the Gariſon there.
Colonel <hi>Potbus</hi>'s Regiment of <hi>Suedes</hi> in the King of
<hi>Spain</hi>'s Service was one; he was pleas'd to grumble
and to expreſs his diſguſt for this command up and
down <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> for which the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi>
order'd him to be put in Arreſt there.</p>
                  <p>On the <hi>7th.</hi> the Army marched from <hi>VVemmel</hi> to
<hi>Noſtre dame de Halle.</hi> Our Left reached conſiderably
beyond <hi>Tubiſe,</hi> and our Right beyond <hi>Halle,</hi> ſo that
we ſeem'd to take up more Ground this Year, than
we did the laſt before the Action at <hi>Steenkirk.</hi> The
King took his Quarter at the ſame place where he
had it laſt Year, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Lembeck,</hi> a Houſe belonging
to the Prince of <hi>Steenhuys.</hi> The Mareſchal <hi>de Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg,</hi>
who hitherto had Incamp'd quietly at
<hi>Warem</hi> ſince the Fight at <hi>Landen,</hi> began to move
on the <hi>5th,</hi> and march'd that day to <hi>Bonef</hi> upon
the <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> and the next day to <hi>Sombref,</hi> where
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95918:60"/>
he halted the <hi>7th.</hi> The <hi>8th.</hi> he marched on to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velle,</hi>
and had his Right at <hi>Bois Seigneur Iſaac;</hi> and
tho' 'twas now a more favourable Seaſon to have
formed the Siege of <hi>Charleroy,</hi> yet <hi>Luxembourg</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
had been ſo diſorder'd at <hi>Landen,</hi> that tho' they
had then double our Army, yet now <hi>Luxembourg</hi>
was not in a condition to Beſiege <hi>Charleroy</hi> till he had
been reinforced conſiderably with the Troops that
Guarded the Coaſts of <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Brittany,</hi> who
were order'd forthwith towards this Country, and
with the Body the Marquis <hi>de la Valette</hi> commanded
in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame day that we marched from <hi>Wemmel</hi> to
<hi>Halle,</hi> Lieutenant-General <hi>Scravenmoor</hi> came from
<hi>Namur</hi> and joyned us upon this march, where he
waited upon the King to give him an account of
his Impriſonment, and what he had learned with the
Enemies. On the <hi>10th.</hi> Brigadier <hi>Churchill</hi>'s Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was order'd to Gariſon at <hi>Malines;</hi> this Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had ſuffer'd very much at <hi>Lare,</hi> where 'twas
ſent to reinforce Brigadier <hi>Ramſay,</hi> but more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
in the loſs of their Colours which were taken
by the Enemy, two of the Enſigns that carried them
were kill'd, and the third taken Priſoner. On the
<hi>16th.</hi> the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> came to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> with the
Engliſh and Scotch Officers and Soldiers that had
been taken Priſoners at <hi>Landen.</hi> He was Treated
very civilly at <hi>Namur;</hi> the Count <hi>de Guiſcard</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
took him into his own Houſe, where he
was attended with all the care and reſpect they could
expreſs to a Perſon of ſo much worth and of ſo great
Quality, and the ableſt Phyſicians and Surgeons of
the Army were ſent to <hi>Namur</hi> to look after him.
His Grace took at this time the greateſt care ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95918:61"/>
for his Majeſty's Intereſt, for tho' he was ſo
ill for the two firſt days after his arrival at <hi>Namur,</hi>
that the ableſt Surgeons doubted of his Life, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the illneſs of his condition, he ſent for the
Officers that were Priſoners there, and made them
come into his Chamber, and told them that whatever
Money they wanted either for themſelves or for the
Soldiers, he would give it them, and beg'd of them,
that for their King and Countries ſake, they would
take ſuch care of the poor Soldiers that were Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
that want and neceſſity might not force them
to take on in the Enemy's Service contrary to their
inclinations. His Grace order'd the Officers Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in the Town. Moſt of our Priſoners were ſent
afterwards to <hi>Dinant,</hi> each Foot Soldier receiv'd <hi>7 s.</hi>
and <hi>6 d.</hi> to ſubſiſt him, and each Horſeman a <hi>Piſtole;</hi>
they were afterwards remov'd again to <hi>Charlemon<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,</hi>
and they receiv'd the ſame Summ; ſo that ſuch care
was taken for our Priſoners, that not ſix either <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
or <hi>Scots</hi> took Service with the Enemy, and of
thoſe few 'tis to be preſum'd, that they were ſuch
who would of themſelves have deſerted to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
on the firſt opportunity. The Priſoners that
were wounded were put into the King's Hoſpital at
<hi>Namur,</hi> and carefully look'd after. I muſt not omit
at the ſame time to ſay ſomething of the Condition
of our Engliſh and Scots Officers that have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the late King in <hi>France,</hi> or that have ſince deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from our Service to betake themſelves to his, of
which I have had an account by the ſame Ingenious
Perſon that was Priſoner at <hi>Namur,</hi> and who ſaw
and convers'd with ſome of them daily. Not three
of them are yet provided for, and this Gentleman
ſaw many of his acquaintance that had been Officers
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95918:61"/>
in our Troops who ſtill carried Muſquets: and tho'
the <hi>French</hi> have form'd ſeveral Bodies both of Horſe
and Foot of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in their Service, yet there are
not above three Engliſh or Scots Officers that have
a Commiſſion amongſt them, by which a Man may
ſee that 'tis ſtill a Crime in the late King's Court to be
an <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> and a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and ſuch a one as
renders them uncapable of a Commiſſion in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
His beloved Iriſh Roman Catholicks are the
only prefer'd. The day after the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi>
arriv'd at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> he came to the Camp at <hi>Halle</hi> to
wait upon his Majeſty, tho' he was ſtill very weak,
and return'd the ſame Evening.</p>
                  <p>Moſt part of the time that we continued in this
Camp at <hi>Halle,</hi> the Weather proved ſo exceſſive hot,
that it caus'd a great Sickneſs in both Armies: The
Soldiers fell ſick daily, and many Officers. My Lord
of <hi>Athlone</hi> went ſick into <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> Prince <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi>
the Lord <hi>George Hamilton,</hi> and many others of note.
Colonel <hi>Monroe</hi> dyed, and his Majeſty has beſtow'd
the Regiment upon Colonel <hi>Ferguſon</hi> his Lieutenant-Colonel.
Prince <hi>Caſimir</hi> of <hi>Naſſau</hi> left the Army
here, and returned towards <hi>Leewarden</hi> in <hi>Friezland,</hi>
after he had order'd his Equipage to be ſold. The
Prince of <hi>Birkenfeldt</hi> Lieutenant-General in the States
Service did the ſame. On the <hi>18th.</hi> Prince <hi>Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi>
who was now pretty well recover'd of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition,
was preſented to the Dutch Guards for
their Colonel. Both Battalions were drawn out, and
the King, attended with all the General Officers and
the whole Court, came and preſented him himſelf.
All the Officers of the Regiment were called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
near his Majeſty, who made a ſhort Speech to
them, to let them know that he could not give them
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95918:62"/>
a more deſerving Colonel than the Duke of <hi>Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg;</hi>
afterwards his Majeſty ſpoke to the Duke,
and made him a ſhort Compliment, then the King
took a half Pike which was held by one of his Pages,
and put it in the Duke's right hand. The two Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions
had their Arms preſented all this while, and
then the King commanded himſelf the Drums to
beat a March. Afterwards the Duke marched on
Foot at the head of the Regiment before the King,
and ſo the Ceremony ended.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>19th</hi> the Mareſchal <hi>de Luxembourg</hi> left his
Camp at <hi>Nivelle,</hi> and marched to <hi>Soignies,</hi> in order
to joyn the <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Britany</hi> Troops that came
to reinforce his Army, for the Siege of <hi>Charleroy;</hi>
Thoſe likewiſe which the Marquis <hi>la Vallette</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
within the Lines were order'd to joyn him
here, and other Battalions that were not in ſo good
a condition were ſent into their places. 'Twas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that <hi>Luxembourg</hi> ſhould advance thus far not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the deſign'd Siege of <hi>Charleroy,</hi> becauſe
his Army was not yet in a condition to undertake it,
and therefore he reſerv'd the Forrage thereabouts for
that time; alſo becauſe he was here more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
Poſted for the reinforcement to joyn him,
which otherwiſe we could have diſturb'd if his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
had been farther off, and likewiſe to conſume
the Forrage hereabouts to hinder our Army from
marching towards the <hi>Sambre</hi> for the relief of
<hi>Charleroy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame day that the <hi>French</hi> march'd to <hi>Soignies,</hi>
we ſent two Regiments to reinforce the Gariſon of
<hi>Ath; Spaarvelt</hi>'s Regiment of <hi>Swedes</hi> was one. The
<hi>Finland</hi> and <hi>Zeeland</hi> Battalions of <hi>Danes</hi> were ſent
to Gariſon in <hi>Ghendt;</hi> they were weak, and had
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95918:62"/>
ſuffer'd at <hi>Landen.</hi> We had likewiſe 900 Priſoners
returned to us this day by the Enemy, which was
all that remained of what they had taken in the laſt
Battel. As ſoon as the King heard of the Enemies
marching, Orders were given for our Army to be
ready to march; and the ſame day the Baggage and
Artillery were ſent before under the Eſcorte of the
firſt Battalion of the Royal Regiment. And on the
<hi>20th.</hi> early in the Morning, the Army march'd, and
encamp'd at <hi>St. Quintin Linneck,</hi> where the King
took his Quarters, and the Elector at <hi>Goicke.</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
were given for the Armies marching again
the next day: accordingly the General-beat, for
the King had been inform'd that the <hi>French</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
their march towards <hi>Ath,</hi> but the King was
ſoon after inform'd, that 'twas only a Detachment
of about 6000 Men that the Enemy had ſent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Grammont</hi> and <hi>Leſſines,</hi> which they afterwards
countermanded; upon which our Army remain'd in
the Camp at <hi>St. Quintin Linneck.</hi> In the Afternoon
the King rid out upon the Left to<note n="*" place="margin">A Term us'd when a General of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my rides out to view and obſerve the ſeveral Poſts about his Camp.</note> 
                     <hi>Reconnoitre;</hi>
and beſides the uſual Detachment of his Life-Guards
he took a good Party of <hi>Eppinger</hi>'s Dragoons to
ride juſt before him, becauſe the King went to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
ſeveral narrow <hi>Defilés</hi> in a Wood upon our
Left. Theſe Dragoons fell in with a Party of about
<hi>30 French</hi> Horſe, under the Command of a Cornet,
the King order'd them himſelf to charge them, and
they took 17 Priſoners. Another Party of them had
the ſame Fortune this day near <hi>Noſtre Dame de Halle:</hi>
this Party had come from the Gariſon of <hi>Mons</hi> to ſee
what Straglers they could take after we had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd
from this place: A Party of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> far
Inferiour to them in number, met with them, kill'd
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:95918:63"/>
ſome upon the place, and took moſt of them Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.
'Twas ſaid that they had taken one of our
Officers Priſoners (as he was riding from <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to
<hi>Halle)</hi> that knew nothing of our being march'd
from thence, and that he was kill'd amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>On the <hi>25th</hi> the Duke of <hi>Holſtein Ploen</hi> came to
the Camp. The States have choſen him to be Velt-Mareſchal
General of their Forces, and Governour
of <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> in the room of the late Prince <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck,</hi>
and have given him the ſame advantages
which his Predeceſſor had. He was Velt-Mareſchal
General of the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s Forces, and is
come by his leave, and with his conſent to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the States. His Brother is Admiral of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
and was ſent laſt Year to <hi>Newport,</hi> to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
there, when the <hi>French</hi> drew near this place,
after they had ſo eaſily made themſelves Maſters of
<hi>Furnes,</hi> and he has a very large and ſtately Houſe
that Fronts the Governours Palace at <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> This
Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> is moſt particularly Famous for the
Action at <hi>Treves,</hi> in the Year 1675. He Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
then a Body of the Allies, with which he
fell upon the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> who was poſted
in a very ſtrong Camp near this place. He ſuffer'd
the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> to come quietly by a
very difficult Paſs to his Camp, for he computed
them as ſo many men loſt, and that he would cut
them to pieces. The Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed
with the Sieur <hi>Vignory,</hi> Governour of
<hi>Treves,</hi> to come and joyn him with his Gariſon
about 5000 ſtrong; but as the Governour was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
back over the Bridge, to order the Gariſon to
draw out, ſome body fir'd a Piſtol, which made
his Horſe fling ſo violently, that he threw him over
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95918:63"/>
the Bridge into the <hi>Foſsé,</hi> and broke his Neck. The
Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> that had paſſed the <hi>Defilé,</hi> fell
upon the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> and gave him an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Rout. The Mareſchal juſt ſav'd himſelf in the
Town of <hi>Treves.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> came with
his Army, and after he had joyn'd the Duke of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein,</hi>
form'd the Siege of this place, which <hi>Holſtein</hi>
had Inveſted upon his late Succeſs. The Mareſchal
<hi>de Crequi</hi> made a moſt deſperate reſiſtance to redeem
his Credit. He Fortified the great Church, after
the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had made himſelf Maſter of the
Works of the Town, where he defended himſelf ſo
well, that tho' this Town is not very ſtrong, yet he
held out in all a Siege of 35 days, and at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
to ſign the Capitulation, becauſe he was a
Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> and thought he could not in
Honour ſign a Capitulation for any of the King his
Maſter's Towns; for which reaſon he was made Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
of War, and carried to <hi>Coblentz.</hi> Two Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions
of <hi>Dunbarton</hi>'s Regiment ſtood by him in the
deſperate defence of the Town, when the <hi>French</hi>
mutinied to ſurrender; for which good Service the
French King afterwards expreſſed his thankfulneſs
to the Regiment. Since this digreſſion does not
come in <hi>Mal-a-propos,</hi> I thought my ſelf oblig'd to
mention this, becauſe none of the French Writers
have been ſo juſt as to give the Honour and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
due to our Soldiers for this ſervice.</p>
                  <p>On the <hi>27th.</hi> the Prince of <hi>Naſſau Sarbruck</hi> being
Indiſpos'd in the Camp, left the Army to go to the
Baths of <hi>Aix la Chappelle,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Bois le
Duc,</hi> of which place he is Governour; and the day
following my Lord <hi>Sidney</hi> arriv'd here from <hi>England,</hi>
and had all the Honours paid to him that are due to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95918:64"/>
the Maſter of the Ordnance, which Office was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
upon him after his Lordſhip had left <hi>Ireland.</hi>
The Dutch Troop of Guards was ſent from this
Camp to <hi>Loo,</hi> and to ſeveral Villages upon the
Road to it, to Eſcorte His Majeſty thither by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefs,
and to do duty there and at the <hi>Hague,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
His Majeſty's ſtay in <hi>Holland.</hi> We have ſaid,
in the relation of the Fight at <hi>Landen,</hi> that ſeveral
Soldiers had fled after our Defeat to <hi>Breda,</hi> where
many of them took the opportunity to deſert to
<hi>Holland,</hi> many alſo had got thither before; for
which reaſon the King caus'd Letters to be writ to
the Magiſtrates of <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and other Sea-Port
Towns, to apprehend all Engliſh and Scots Soldiers
they found there; to which Order they readily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
tho' they could have pleaded the Privileges
of their Towns. After the apprehenſion of theſe
Soldiers the Grand Provoſt had them brought ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Camp, and thirty of the Engliſh and Scots
Brigades, beſides that of the Guards, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to dye for Deſertion, but the King graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
Pardon'd Four and Twenty of them; the
other ſix that had drawn the Lots for Death, were
Executed on the fifth of <hi>September,</hi> at the head of
their reſpective Brigades; ſix of the Brigade of
Guards were condemned, and three drew Lots to
dye (the other three Pardon'd) and were accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
Hang'd at the head of their Regiments the
day following.</p>
                  <p>On the <hi>30th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the <hi>French</hi> left their Camp
at <hi>Soignies</hi> to come nearer to the <hi>Sambre,</hi> all things
being now in a readineſs for the Siege of <hi>Charleroy.
La Vallette,</hi> and the <hi>Brittanny</hi> and <hi>Normandy</hi> Troops
had joyn'd them; and beſides, the Mareſchal <hi>de
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95918:64"/>
Boufflers</hi> was detach'd back from the <hi>Rhine</hi> with 12
Battalions to make their Work ſo ſure that the Allies
might not be in a condition to Relieve it. All
theſe precautions are very evident Arguments of
what the <hi>French</hi> fuffer'd, and how much they were
weaken'd at <hi>Landen.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> march'd this day
to <hi>Hayne St. Pierre,</hi> and <hi>Hayne St. Paul,</hi> and the
<hi>31ſt.</hi> they continued their March nearer to <hi>Charleroy,</hi>
and encamp'd by the River <hi>Pieton,</hi> their Right at
<hi>Goüy</hi> and <hi>Pont de Celles,</hi> and their Left at <hi>Fontaine
l' Eveſque,</hi> and the River before them. The ſame
day <hi>Charleroy</hi> was Inveſted by the Count <hi>de Guiſcard,</hi>
Lieutenant General and Governour of <hi>Namur,</hi> who
had march'd the day before from this place with ſix
Battalions of his Gariſon, and a Regiment of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons,
which ſufficiently ſhews what ſhifts the <hi>French</hi>
were put to for Foot to carry on the Siege, ſince
they drew out theſe Battalions that had not at firſt
been thought fit to bring into the Field. The Count
<hi>de Guiſcard,</hi> encamp'd that day at <hi>Covillet,</hi> on t'other
ſide of the <hi>Sambre;</hi> and at the ſame time Lieutenant
General <hi>Ximenes</hi> took his Poſt on this ſide at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chienne
au pont,</hi> with 16 Squadrons of Horſe, and a
Regiment of Dragoons. The day following the
Count <hi>de Guiſcard</hi> paſſed the <hi>Sambre</hi> below <hi>Charleroy,</hi>
and encamp'd at <hi>Montigny. Rubantel,</hi> Lieutenant
General, and <hi>Vauban</hi> Engineer General, took theirs
at <hi>Gilly,</hi> with 32 Battalions, and 34 Squadrons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd
from the Army. In the mean while the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery,
Pontons, Mortar-Pieces, and all other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries
for a Siege were ſent from <hi>Namur</hi> and
<hi>Maubeuge</hi> by Water, and the Ingeniers who had
been commanded to rendezvous at <hi>Mons,</hi> came to
the Camp before <hi>Charleroy.</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Vauban</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:95918:65"/>
to put this place into the French King's hands
within 15 days at moſt from the opening of the
Trenches.<note place="margin">Septemb.</note>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Charleroy</hi> is ſituated upon the beſt paſs of the
<hi>Sambre,</hi> for this River runs generally between rocky
Hills and ſteep Banks; for which reaſon 'tis not
paſſable by an Army but at few places, and this
where <hi>Charleroy</hi> is built to Command it, is the beſt.
The Town, which at the beſt is but a very indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
one, is ſeated on the other ſide of the <hi>Sambre,</hi>
and the Fortifications are very weak. 'Twas Bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barded
laſt Year by the Mareſchal <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> for
two days together. But the ſtrength of <hi>Charleroy</hi>
is on this ſide of the Water, ſituated upon a Hill
that commands the River, and a great part of it
rocky Ground, where 'tis very difficult to make any
Trenches. Tho' 'tis a perfect Hill towards the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
yet on t'other ſide of the place 'tis much plainer,
and is ſomewhat commanded by ſeveral Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heights. In the Year 1666 this place was but
an inconſiderable Village, call'd <hi>Charnoy;</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it commanded this Paſs upon the <hi>Sambre</hi> the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> Fortified it, and call'd it <hi>Charleroy,</hi> for
their King's ſake, who is nam'd <hi>Charles;</hi> but the
French King call'd it <hi>Charlamoy,</hi> to jeſt upon the
Name, which Jeſt ſoon after prov'd a very true one,
for he took it the Year following, and kept it by the
Treaty of <hi>Aix la Chappelle.</hi> 'Twas Beſieged the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end of the Year 1672. by our King, then Prince
of <hi>Orange,</hi> who us'd a very cunning Stratagem to
get the Count <hi>de Montal,</hi> the Governour, out of it.
He was Governor both of <hi>Tongres</hi> and this place. The
King made a Feint to Beſiege <hi>Tongres,</hi> which made
the Count <hi>de Montal</hi> leave <hi>Charleroy</hi> for the defence
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95918:65"/>
of that Place, whereupon the Count <hi>de Marſin,</hi> who
Commanded a ſmall Body, was order'd by the
King to Inveſt <hi>Charleroy,</hi> and he at the ſame time
left <hi>Tongres</hi> to go and Beſiege it. <hi>Montal</hi> was very
much concern'd to be ſo trick'd out of the place,
and that made him ſo deſperate that he forced his
way into it in the middle of the Night, and got in
through the Beſiegers Camp with about 100 Horſe
along with him; however, if the Weather had
been more favourable, the King would have carried
it before any Relief cou'd have come to it; but the
Weather prov'd ſo unkind for ſuch an Attempt, that
the <hi>French</hi> had the time to make up their Army,
and upon their advancing the King rais'd the Siege.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French,</hi> whilſt this place was in their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
Fortified it very well, and made all the Baſtions
and Half-Moons with Brick and Free-ſtone, and
ſome of the laſt have very good Counter-Guards
to cover them. They have a great many Redoubts
round the place, at the foot of the Glacis, under
the defence of the cover'd way, all very ſtrong,
and built with Brick and Free-ſtone. This place
was reſtor'd to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> by the Treaty of
<hi>Nimeguen,</hi> in a far better condition than it had
been before in the hands of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> they
have ſince this War added very little to the Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of <hi>Charleroy;</hi> except ſome few Mines under
the Glacis and Angles of the cover'd way, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermoſt
of the Works of the Town, to blow them
up when taken by the Enemy. There is a large Pond
of Water that covers part of the place, between
<hi>Bruſſels</hi> Port and the way to <hi>Fontaine l'Eveſque,</hi>
with a good Redoubt in the very middle of it, and
another for the defence of the Sluce, cover'd by a
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95918:66"/>
Horn-work. The <hi>French</hi> brought a prodigious
Train of Artillery and Mortar-Pieces before the
Place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſoon reduc'd the Houſes and Barracks in
it to Aſhes: They fir'd their Cannon perpetually,
whole Batteries at a time, and likewiſe Mortar-Pieces,
which they fir'd together by Batteries in
the Beſieged's Works to diſlodge them.</p>
                  <p>On the <hi>2d.</hi> the <hi>French</hi> began to trace out their
Lines, and the <hi>3d.</hi> they put 12000 Pioneers on Work
about them; the <hi>4th.</hi> they prepar'd two Attacks,
and the <hi>5th.</hi> at Night the Duke of <hi>Roquelaure,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal
de Camp, open'd the Trench before the
place with the Regiment of <hi>Navarre.</hi> Six Battali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the French and Suiſs Guards, and the King's
Regiment mounted the Trench: and the Rain, and
a Fog which happen'd then, made the Air ſo thick,
that the Enemies work'd three hours before the
Beſieged perceived it. The <hi>French,</hi> at the ſame
time, attack'd an Out-Poſt call'd the <hi>Warren-Houſe,</hi>
and carried it after a vigorous reſiſtance, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
men kill'd and wounded on both ſides; a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Guards was wounded in this Action, and
the Enemy loſt about 40 men in carrying on the left
Attack. The next day the Beſieged made a <hi>Sortie</hi>
upon the Enemies, kill'd many, among the reſt the
Count <hi>de Broglio</hi> the Son, who was kill'd juſt by
the Marquiſs <hi>de Crequi,</hi> one of their Inginiers was
Wounded, and <hi>Grandcomb</hi> Brigadier of the Ingi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers
made Priſoner, and the Marquis of <hi>Rochefort,</hi>
and a Captain, Wounded.</p>
                  <p>On the <hi>7th.</hi> the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> was detach'd
from our Army at <hi>St. Quintin Linneck</hi> towards
<hi>Flanders,</hi> with a Body of 30 Battalions and 50 Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons;
16 of theſe Battalions were Engliſh and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95918:66"/>
Scots, <hi>viz.</hi> The Second Battalion of the Firſt Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Guards, <hi>Talmaſh</hi>'s Battalion, Two Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of Scots Guards, (and theſe mounted the
Guard upon his Electoral Highneſs whilſt he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
this Body) two Battalions of the Royal
Regiment, <hi>Bathe, Tidcomb, Caſtleton, Graham, Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
Mackay, Leven, Lauder, Ferguſon,</hi> and <hi>Argyle;</hi>
Six <hi>Danes, viz.</hi> The Guards, the Queens, Prince <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric,</hi>
Prince <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> Prince <hi>George,</hi> and the <hi>Jutland</hi>
Battalions; two <hi>Dutch, viz.</hi> Count <hi>Horne,</hi> and <hi>Bern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorff;</hi>
and the ſix <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> Battalions in the
King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Service. Theſe were detached, as
'twas ſuppos'd, to attack <hi>Furnes,</hi> to recompence by
this the loſs of <hi>Charleroy,</hi> which would have given
great eaſe to <hi>Newport.</hi> For the <hi>French</hi> had muſter'd
all their Forces to make this Siege, and expected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the Mareſchal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> from the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to
re-inforce them with twelve Battalions and fourteen
Squadrons, ſo that, beſides this ſmall Body which
they expected with <hi>Boufflers,</hi> they had above 100
Battalions to beſiege and cover the ſiege of <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy;</hi>
and if their Battalions were moſt of them
weak, none of ours were very ſtrong, and Sickneſs
had ſent a great Number into the Hoſpitals, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
of the King's Troops which weakn'd them
extreamly; beſides, the <hi>French</hi> had eaten up all the
Forrage between <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and the <hi>Sambre,</hi> except
what they cover'd for the ſubſiſtence of their
Troops; ſo that there was no poſſibility for our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's
marching that way to attempt its Relief, even
if it had been in a better Condition. As therefore
there was no proſpect of relieving <hi>Charleroy,</hi> the
Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> commanded this Body for ſome
enterprize in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and march'd this day as far
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:95918:67"/>
as <hi>Ayegem Capelle,</hi> after he had paſs'd the <hi>Dender</hi> at
<hi>Ninove,</hi> with a good Train of Artillery; and the
next pay he marched to <hi>Gavre</hi> upon the <hi>Scheld:</hi> The
Ways were ſo bad and deep that the Artillery could
not come up till the next day, and ſeveral Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
and Carriages came to damage. Orders were
given to be ready to march, but we halted the next
day. The <hi>French</hi> had left <hi>Furnes</hi> in a good Poſture
of Defence, with about 5000 Men in Gariſon, and
we found the Ways ſuch that 'twas very difficult
and hazardous to draw our Artillery. And beſides,
the Mareſchal <hi>de Luxembourg</hi> upon the News of this
Detachment, march'd from his Camp at <hi>Herlaymont-Capelle</hi>
to <hi>Eſtines,</hi> nearer to <hi>Mons,</hi> and to the King's
Army, which was now but ſmall after ſo great a
Detachment; upon which the King did not think it
ſafe to venture this Detachment any further, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to give <hi>Luxembourg</hi> the opportunity to have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
upon him; therefore this Body was counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.
But before the Elector marched back, he
detach'd <hi>Horne</hi>'s and <hi>Bernſtorf</hi>'s Regiments to the
Gariſon of <hi>Newport,</hi> and the ſame day <hi>Offerrel</hi>'s and
<hi>Ferguſon</hi>'s Regiments were ſent to Winter Quarters,
the firſt to <hi>Bruges,</hi> and the latter to <hi>Oſtend.</hi> On
the <hi>11th.</hi> which was the day following, the Elector
march'd with the Body under his Command to
St. <hi>Levinus-Haltheim</hi> in order to rejoyn the King at
<hi>Ninove,</hi> who had march'd hither from St. <hi>Quintin-Linneck</hi>
the day before; and in leaving this Camp
the King order'd to <hi>Louvain</hi> the Regiments of <hi>Ecker,</hi>
and <hi>Fagel,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Aylua, Anhalt,</hi> and <hi>Oxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtierne</hi>
to <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> The <hi>12th.</hi> the Elector rejoyn'd
the King at <hi>Ninove.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:95918:67"/>
On the <hi>13th.</hi> about 900 Engliſh Recruits came
up to the Camp, 300 of them were for the Guards,
and the other ſix that had been drawn out of the
Princeſs <hi>Ann</hi>'s, Sir <hi>David Collier</hi>'s, <hi>Haſting</hi>'s, Prince
of <hi>Heſſe</hi>'s, St. <hi>George</hi>'s, and <hi>Tiffeney</hi>'s Regiments
were divided by Lot amongſt the Engliſh Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that had ſuffered moſt at <hi>Landen.</hi> On the
<hi>14th.</hi> the King's Domeſticks left the Camp to go to
<hi>Loo,</hi> and the day after the King, ſeeing that nothing
could be done for the relief of <hi>Charleroy,</hi> and that
the Campagne drew near to an end, left the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Army in the Elector's Hands, and
went by <hi>Breda</hi> to <hi>Loo,</hi> in order to repaſs ſoon after
the Sea to meet his Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
Matters for a more vigorous Proſecution of the
War, according to the Reſolution taken by the reſt
of the Allies; and the King's Guards did after
Duty upon the Elector, and gave him the ſame
Honours that they are oblig'd to ſhew to the King.
The <hi>18th.</hi> the two Battalions of <hi>Frieſland,</hi> Guards
to Prince <hi>Caſimir</hi> of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> were ſent to Gariſon in
<hi>Louvain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean while the <hi>French</hi> purſued very vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
the Village of <hi>Charleroy,</hi> and the Gariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
4 and 5000 ſtrong commanded by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs
<hi>de Caſtillo,</hi> Maſter of the Spaniſh Ordnance,
Colonel <hi>Pimentel</hi> the Governor, and <hi>Bulau</hi> Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> made as brave and noble reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
The <hi>French</hi> fir'd continually their Cannon
and Mortars to make the Place as uneaſie as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
they could to the beſieged. They batter'd
to Pieces the Redoubt or detach'd Baſtion that
is without <hi>Bruſſels Port,</hi> but it was ſo Min'd that the
Enemies would not venture to take it. They
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:95918:68"/>
changed their Attack to the Horn-work that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
the Sluce of the Pond, and to the Redoubt
that was in the middle of it; and the Enemies had
now advanc'd their Works within ten or twelve
paces of the outer Angles of the cover'd Way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Pond, and on the other ſide beyond the
Point of the Horn-work upon its Flank. The
Enemies Cannon had fired hitherto ſo furiouſly that
they had diſmounted all the Cannon the beſieged
had; but on the <hi>12th.</hi> the Beſieged made a ſhift to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
two or three Pieces, and in the Night they kill'd
and wounded about 100 of the Enemies, among
whom were ſome Officers. <hi>De Pont</hi> an Ingenier
was wounded mortally. The <hi>13th.</hi> the beſieged
fired a Bomb which fell in the Magazine of Powder
upon one of the Enemies Batteries, kill'd ſix Men,
and diſmounted two of their Cannon. The <hi>French</hi>
continu'd their fire upon the two Redoubts, that
without <hi>Bruſſels Port,</hi> and that in the Pond; in this
laſt a Spaniſh Captain with 50 Men was poſted for
its defence; and beſides the Batteries of Cannon
they fir'd againſt it, they threw twice more Bombs
into the Place than there were Men to defend it.
They fir'd their Mortars here by Batteries, ſo that
the Soldiers had ten or twelve Bombs ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their Ears. On the <hi>14th.</hi> in the Afternoon
Monſieur <hi>de Vauban</hi> order'd ſix Pontons to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten'd
together, upon which a Detachment was ſent
for the Aſſault of the Redoubt in the Pond. The
<hi>Spaniards</hi> were now reduc'd to little above half the
Number, notwithſtanding they made a good reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
but at laſt were forc'd to Capitulate. The
ſame Day the Duke of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> who had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
as far as <hi>Mons</hi> (upon our Detachment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:95918:68"/>
                     <hi>Flanders)</hi> return'd to the Camp by <hi>Charleroy,</hi>
after he heard that the Elector had rejoyn'd the
King at <hi>Ninove.</hi> He left the King's Houſe conton'd
near St. <hi>Guiſlain</hi> for the conveniency of Forage, and
generally all the Horſe between <hi>Mons, Valenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennes,</hi>
and <hi>Maubeuge.</hi> The French and Suiſſe Guards
remain'd at <hi>Eſtines,</hi> and another Body at <hi>Givry.</hi>
The <hi>15th.</hi> the Beſieged made a very brave <hi>Sortie;</hi>
they levell'd part of the Enemies Works, and
kill'd many of the Enemies; a Captain was kill'd,
and the Marquis of <hi>Charroſt</hi> wounded. On the <hi>16th.</hi>
in the Evening the Enemies attack'd the Work that
cover'd the Sluce of the Pond, 120 Men defended it
very bravely, but at laſt the <hi>French</hi> made themſelves.
Maſters of it, after they had loſt 50 Men in the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack,
a Captain and two Ingeniers wounded.
When the Enemies had made themſelves Maſters of
the Redoubt in the Pond, and of the Work that
cover'd the Sluce, they began to drain it. The
<hi>19th.</hi> the beſieged made a very brave and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Sortie,</hi> they beat the Enemies from a great part
of their Works, which they deſtroyed and levell'd,
and kill'd the Enemies a great many Men. The
<hi>22d.</hi> the Beſieged made another <hi>Sortie</hi> upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
which proved not ſo ſucceſsful as the former.
They wounded a Lieutenant-Colonel and five In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniers,
and in the Afternoon one of their Bombs
fell among ſome Magazines of the Enemies Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nades,
but they took ſuch care that it did them no
great damage. The <hi>23d.</hi> the Beſieged continu'd
their <hi>Sortie,</hi> but were repuls'd.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Day we made a very great Detachment
of 28 Men <hi>per</hi> Battalion from our Army at <hi>Ninove,</hi>
with a proportionable number of Horſe, under the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95918:69"/>
Command of Lieutenant-General <hi>Opdam,</hi> to Eſcorte
a Convoy of 250 Waggons, and ſeven Pieces of
Cannon, into <hi>Ath.</hi> The Waggons were loaded
with all manner of Proviſions and Ammunitions,
which got ſafely into the Place that Evening. <hi>Wey</hi>'s
Regiment was ſent at the ſame to re-inforce the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of this Place. Lieutenant-General <hi>Opdam,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his return, found that the Country-people about
<hi>Leſſines</hi> had made a great quantity of Beer, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
that the French Army would come and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp
there, as uſually it did every Year; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they had not brought it to be ſold in our
Camp, the Convoy Waggons that return'd empty
from <hi>Ath</hi> had orders to take all this Beer away, and
to bring it into our Camp at <hi>Ninove.</hi> We made
much about the ſame time a good Detachment out
of all our Dragoons, and 'twas reported that their
Deſign was to ſteal a Relief into <hi>Charleroy;</hi> that <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
Son to the Major that Commands into the <hi>Bois
de Sognes,</hi> was to take care of it, and conduct
them to the Place by the moſt ſecret ways, and ſo to
ſurprize in the Night the French Camp, and force
their way into the Town. But <hi>Jacob,</hi> as he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the moſt convenient ways for the Deſign,
was made Priſoner. This is a report we had in our
Camp.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>24th.</hi> the Enemy aſſaulted the Horn-Work
and Half-Moon upon their Right Attack, which
they at laſt carried with ſome loſs on their ſide.
The <hi>25th.</hi> the Enemy made a very furious Aſſault
upon the Counterſcarp of the Body of the Place,
but the Beſieged made a very gallant reſiſtance, and
repuls'd the Enemy ſeveral times one after another,
which doubtleſs could not be without ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:95918:69"/>
loſs on the Enemies ſide. 'Tis ſaid they
loſt above 600 Men. The Attack laſted five hours.
The <hi>26th.</hi> they made another Aſſault upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſcarp,
but as fruitleſs as the former. The <hi>28th.</hi> the
Enemies made themſelves at laſt Maſters of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſcarp,
and lodg'd themſelves in the cover'd Way,
the whole length of the Front of their Attacks from
Right to Left. The beſieg'd ſprung a Mine under
one of the Angles of the Counterſcarp: Two of
their Captains were wounded, and an Ingenier kill'd.
On the <hi>29th.</hi> the Beſiegers deſcended the <hi>Foſſé</hi> to fix
their Miner to the Body of the Place, and made all
things ready for a general Aſſault the next day, and
'twas very much feared in our Camp that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<hi>del Caſtillo</hi>'s brave Obſtinacy would reduce the
Gariſon to this laſt extremity of being carried by
Aſſault, and put to the Sword. The <hi>30th.</hi> the
<hi>French</hi> play'd very furiouſly with their Artillery up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Place. The Mareſchal <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> who had
the Command of the Siege, ſummon'd the Governor
to Surrender, which he refus'd: Upon which they
made a general Aſſault upon the Breach, which the
Beſieged receiv'd very vigorouſly, and oblig'd the
Enemies to retire: But being now ſenſible that they
could not reſiſt another, on <hi>Sunday</hi> the firſt of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
about eight in the morning, the Governor, with
the Advice of the chief Officers of the Gariſon, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to beat the Chamade, and Hoſtages were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
exchang'd on both ſides to Capitulate;

            <p>Thus <hi>Charleroy</hi> is fallen once more into the French
King's hands, after a very fine defence which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
beſieged have made; and after a Siege of 26 days
from the opening of the Trench<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 32 from the
time that 'twas Inveſted. Monſieur <hi>de Vauban</hi> had
promis'd to make it the French King's own within
15 days at fartheſt, but he has found that he can
miſtake ſometimes in his Calculation, when he has
to deal with brave Men who will reſolve upon a
ſtout and vigorous Defence. This is but a ſmall
Place, and much inferiour to the Caſtle of <hi>Namur</hi>
for Strength, and yet we find that it has made twice
the reſiſtance. But the French King, to ſave his
Honour, in the Letter to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi>
to order the <hi>Te Deum</hi> to be Sung in his Cathedral
for the Reduction of this Place, ſays, That 'twas
not ſo much the Reſiſtance of the beſieged, as his
own care for the preſervation of his Men, that has
drawn the Siege to ſuch a length: which is a very
unjuſt aſſertion to rob the beſieged of the Honour
due to them for their brave defence, rather than to
let the World think any thing can reſiſt the vigour
of the French Arms. I do not know how much they
ſpared their Men, but 'tis plain they did not ſpare
Cannon, Bombs, nor Ingeniers, ſince a great many
of the latter have left their Bones before this Place;
and 'tis certain, that as ſoon as they have been able
to make themſelves Maſters of the Outworks that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95918:72"/>
cover'd the Glacis and Counterſcarpe of the Place,
they were not very ſparing of their Aſſaults to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the Counterſcarpe, where they have been ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times repuls'd by the bravery of the beſieged.
But whether the French King has been ſo ſparing
of his Subjects in this Siege or no yet this makes
the face of Affairs look quite otherwiſe than 'twas
repreſented after the Fight of <hi>Landen,</hi> for then
<hi>there was nothing but what the Allies ought to fear</hi>
from him <hi>after ſo great a Defeat, there was nothing
but what he might expect after this Succeſs:</hi> And yet
after all theſe Rodomontado's, this Letter to the
Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> to Sing the <hi>Te Deum</hi> for the
taking of <hi>Charleroy,</hi> does ingeniouſly own, that the
French King could not better end this Campagne
than by the Siege of this Place; and the Author is
very careful not to inſinuate in the leaſt that 'tis a
fruit of this ſo great Victory, which gave the French
King reaſon to expect ſo very great Matters; and
therefore if it was ſo, the Allies are very much
oblig'd to him that he would undertake no more,
after ſo important a Victory, than the Siege of
<hi>Charleroy,</hi> and that too ſo late in the Year, when
it muſt cloſe the Succeſs of this Campagne; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
if the <hi>French</hi> had ſo prodigious an advantage at
<hi>Landen,</hi> what is the reaſon they did not ſet down
before this ſmall Place ſooner? for then they would
have had time to beſiege either <hi>Ath</hi> or <hi>Audenarde</hi>
afterwards, which would have given the World
ſome proofs of the great advantage they had at
<hi>Landen.</hi> 'Tis plain therefore that the reaſon why
they did not was, becauſe they were not then able:
and their Army, which then outdid ours by 45 Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions
and above 100 Squadrons, had been too well
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95918:73"/>
paid off there. After the reduction of <hi>Charleroy</hi> the
French King beſtowed this Government upon Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Boiſſelot,</hi> the late Governour of <hi>Limerick.</hi> And
now Winter drawing on, the Armies began on both
ſides to File off towards Winter Quarters.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>3d.</hi> of this Month, a Party of <hi>French</hi>
came by our Camp at <hi>Ninove,</hi> and took ſome of
the Elector's and other Horſes that were grazing on
the other ſide of the <hi>Dender,</hi> below the Windmill,
but upon immediate notice a Detachment was
made of the Elector's Guards and Dragoons, who
took all the Horſes back again, and made ſeveral
Priſoners. On the <hi>4th.</hi> we heard a Triple diſcharge
of the Enemy's Fire for the advantage the Mareſchal
<hi>de Catinat</hi> had got the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>September</hi> over the
Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and his Allies, in the Plains of
<hi>Marſaglia.</hi> We had the News of it the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
by way of <hi>France,</hi> which made the Defeat as
great and as terrible as could be, but we judged of
the truth of the matter by what they had publiſh'd
of the Battle of <hi>Landen.</hi> On the <hi>5th.</hi> our Army
began to ſeparate, and to go into Winter Quarters;
Part of the Gariſon of <hi>Bruges</hi> and <hi>Oſtend</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd,
under the Command of Brigadier <hi>Ramſey,</hi>
to march towards the Canal of <hi>Bruges,</hi> and got the
<hi>7th.</hi> into their Quarters. The <hi>6th.</hi> the Army de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd
from <hi>Ninove,</hi> and repaſs'd the <hi>Dender,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
it and <hi>Aloſt,</hi> and ſo the Foot continued to
march off towards Quarters. The remainder of the
Infantry of the Gariſon of <hi>Bruges</hi> and <hi>Oſtend</hi> left the
Camp under the Command of Sir <hi>Henry Bellaſſis</hi> the
<hi>7th.</hi> and the reſt of the Foot marched off to <hi>Bruſſels,
Ghendt, Louvain, Malines, Dendermond, Leer,</hi> and
<hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> &amp;c. the Horſe continued canton'd up and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95918:73"/>
down the Country between <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and <hi>Ghendt,</hi> till
the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> but the Elector, as ſoon
as the Foot had broke up, left the Army, and went
to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> the place of his reſidence.</p>
            <p>The Mareſchal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> remain'd in the <hi>Condros</hi>
to conſume the Forrage. That part of <hi>Luxembourg</hi>'s
Army that was to Quarter between the <hi>Scheld,</hi> the
<hi>Sambre,</hi> and the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> was ſent to Gariſon, but the
reſt that was to Winter from the <hi>Scheld</hi> to the Sea,
came near <hi>Courtray</hi> to Fortifie that Town, which
they have a mind to put in a Condition to hold a
formal Siege. They made another Detachment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> to Fortifie that Place for a Winter
Quarter, and are ſince ſeparated in their ſeveral Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
all along as near our Frontier as poſſibly they
can, in order not to be idle this Winter if the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proves kind and favourable; and they will be ſo
much the more preſſing and urgent to undertake
ſomething, that they know the Allies are all reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to make new Levies this Winter, to be in a
better Condition the next Campagne to reſiſt the
French Greatneſs, than they have yet been during
this War. Both the Mareſchals of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> and
<hi>Villeroy</hi> are gone to the French Court, to concert
Matters for ſome undertaking, and the Mareſchal <hi>de
Boufflers</hi> remains to Command in <hi>Flanders.</hi> And
now that <hi>Bouffler</hi>'s Detachment of 12 Battalions
from the <hi>Rhine</hi> is Quarter'd in the <hi>Pays de Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi>
that beſides they have now in <hi>Flanders</hi> the
Troops that Guarded the Coaſts of <hi>Normandy</hi> and
<hi>Britanny,</hi> 'tis not doubted but that they will be able
to do us ſome conſiderable Damage this Winter,
unleſs the Allies are very quick both in the recruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and augmenting the Forces they have here. 'Tis
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:95918:74"/>
wholly their Intereſt, and by what hath hitherto
appear'd in this War, 'tis reaſonable to think that
it would not be done in vain, ſince the advantage
that the <hi>French</hi> have hitherto had in this War, has
not proceeded ſo much from their Bravery as from
their Numbers; for in all the Rencounters which
the Allies have had with them this War, it has
plainly appear'd, that they do owe their Succeſs
meerly to the prodigious greatneſs of their Armies:
Therefore, if it be true that all the Allies put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
have more Men and Money than the French
King, I am of opinion they muſt attribute the ill
Succeſs of this War to nothing elſe but their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable
Parcimony, which has rather ſerv'd to
augment the French King's Power, than anſwer'd
in the leaſt the deſign'd ends of the preſent League.
So long as we do all eaſe our Shoulders of the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
'tis reaſonable, nay 'tis neceſſary the <hi>French</hi>
ſhould have Succeſs. Their efforts are vigorous,
and ours are faint and languiſhing. We make the
War as cheap as poſſibly we can, and that onely
ſerves to make it laſt the longer; and the Charges
muſt be the ſame at long-run, but they are far
from being ſo much to our advantage as when our
efforts are great, tho' for the preſent more bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome.
The Allies had as good fling their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
into the Sea, as think to continue the War
with Forces ſo unequal to thoſe of our Enemy's;
for whilſt they continue on this Foot, we onely
ruine and weaken our ſelves, to no other purpoſe
than to increaſe the French Power.</p>
            <p>Whatever ſucceſs the Enemies have had hitherto,
yet ſtill the Iron is hot for the Allies to ſtrike, if
they will but go to the expence of augmenting their
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:95918:74"/>
Forces. The <hi>French</hi> has made very great efforts
this War, and his Treaſures are not inexhauſtible.
It appears rather by the uncertain value of Coin,
which is hardly the ſame two Months together in
<hi>France,</hi> that he is reduc'd to very great ſhifts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh
his Coffers, which were ſo exhauſted the
latter part of this Campagne, that Money was very
ſcarce in his Armies and Gariſons. The Colonels
had only Bills aſſign'd them for the payment of their
Troops, upon which they were to get ready Money
as well as they could. In their Gariſons the Officers
were generally ſo poor that they gave Notes under
their hands for want of Money to pay for their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.
I have heard of one of our Soldiers, that
was two Months in their Service, after they had
made him a Priſoner, and deſerted over to us again,
that for the time he was amongſt them, he received
no more than one French Half-Crown of pay. All
this that I ſay, I have from Gentlemen that have
been among them, and whom I ought to believe,
elſe I ſhould take care not to publiſh this. Beſides,
there reigns a very great Famine and ſcarceneſs of
Corn all over <hi>France;</hi> and in their Conqueſts their
daily Edicts are authentick proofs of it, tho' in the
Preface of thoſe Edicts they endeavour'd to throw
duſt in the Peoples Eyes, but words do not feed hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
Bellies: And we hear daily in this place what
miſery the People ſuffer at <hi>Liſle,</hi> and in other parts
of the French Conqueſts. 'Tis true, this helps the
French King to make his Recruits, and to encreaſe
his Forces, ſince his Subjects muſt either be Soldiers
or ſtarve; but ſtill I dare ſay, that the French King
does not love to ſee his Kingdom in ſo univerſal a
Deſolation, when thoſe who are Soldiers rather
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95918:75"/>
than Starve, leave the Plough, and thus only aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Famine and the publick Calamity. In
ſhort, I may ſafely affirm, that we are all weary of
this War, the French King as well as the Allies; and
therefore what the Allies have to do is to raiſe ſuch
an Army for the next Campagne, as may put them
in a condition to treat of a Peace upon advantageous
terms, and not be forced to accept of ſuch an one
as will only put the French King (after a little breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and that he has repleniſhed his Stores) into a
better capacity to enſlave Chriſtendom, which Peace
is worſe than the worſt of Wars.</p>
            <p>And the Allies have this to encourage their vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Proſecution of this War (I ſpeak particularly
as to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland)</hi> that they have a King
who does yet venture his precious Life for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the common Cauſe, more freely than
they can venture their Purſes. Let the King's
greateſt Enemies conſider but impartially His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Conduct and Circumſtances, and they muſt
be convinc'd, that what the King does, is not out of
any Intereſt of his own, but in an uprightneſs and
ſincerity of Conſcience, to do good to <hi>Europe</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and to us his Subjects in particular. God has
not bleſt His Majeſty and us with an Heir, therefore
he does not ſeek the aggrandizing of a Family. What
then can be the reaſon that the King does ſo freely
and ſo often expoſe his Sacred Perſon to the greateſt
Dangers, but only a publick Chriſtian King-like Spirit
of doing good to his Allies and to his People, and to
procure a firm and laſting eſtabliſhment of Chriſt's
true Religion in its ancient and primitive Purity in
his Kingdoms, and in the Dominions of his other
Proteſtant Allies?</p>

And ſince we have follow'd His Majeſty in this
Hiſtory from the Field, which he left on the <hi>15th.</hi>
to <hi>Loo,</hi> where he arriv'd on the <hi>17th.</hi> we ought to
ſee him ſafe in <hi>England</hi> among his good People, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we finiſh the account of this Campagne. The
King remain'd at <hi>Loo</hi> to divert himſelf (after the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues
of the Field) in Hunting till the <hi>1ſt.</hi> of <hi>Octob.</hi>
that he arriv'd at the <hi>Hague,</hi> where His Majeſty
ſpent ſome time in Conferences with the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and Council of State, who have conſented
to a new Levy of 15000 Men, beſides the 4000
<hi>Suiſſers</hi> rais'd laſt Summer, and to augment propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
their Maritime Forces. The Plenipotenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries
of the other Allies at the <hi>Hague,</hi> have conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the ſame Reſolution according to their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
proportions. The King was now haſtening
over to meet his Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> but he was
detain'd by Storms and contrary Winds till the <hi>28th.</hi>
that His Majeſty ſail'd from <hi>Oranie Polder,</hi> and arriv'd
ſafely the day following about three in the Afternoon
at <hi>Harwich,</hi> and ſo went on to <hi>London,</hi> to the great
joy and ſatisfaction of his good People, to ſee His
Majeſty ſafe amongſt them, after all the great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to which he had expos'd his Perſon this Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne.</p>
